        Welcome to NetHack!                ( description of version 3.6 )

        NetHack is a Dungeons and Dragons like game where you (the adventurer)
descend into the depths of the dungeon in search of the Amulet of Yendor,
reputed to be hidden somewhere below the twentieth level.  You begin your
adventure with a pet that can help you in many ways, and can be trained
to do all sorts of things.  On the way you will find useful (or useless)
items, quite possibly with magic properties, and assorted monsters.  You can
attack a monster by trying to move onto the space a monster is on (but often
it is much wiser to leave it alone).

        Unlike most adventure games, which give you a verbal description of
your location, NetHack gives you a visual image of the dungeon level you are
on.

        NetHack uses the following symbols:

        - and |  The walls of a room, possibly also open doors or a grave.
        .        The floor of a room or a doorway.
        #        A corridor, or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen
                 sink (if your dungeon has sinks), or a drawbridge.
        >        Stairs down: a way to the next level.
        <        Stairs up: a way to the previous level.
        @        You (usually), or another human.
        )        A weapon of some sort.
        [        A suit or piece of armor.
        %        Something edible (not necessarily healthy).
        /        A wand.
        =        A ring.
        ?        A scroll.
        !        A potion.
        (        Some other useful object (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
        $        A pile of gold.
        *        A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).
        +        A closed door, or a spellbook containing a spell
                 you can learn.
        ^        A trap (once you detect it).
        "        An amulet, or a spider web.
        0        An iron ball.
        _        An altar, or an iron chain.
        {        A fountain.
        }        A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.
        \        An opulent throne.
        `        A boulder or statue.
        A to Z, a to z, and several others:  Monsters.
        I        Invisible or unseen monster's last known location

                 You can find out what a symbol represents by typing
                 '/' and following the directions to move the cursor
                 to the symbol in question.  For instance, a 'd' may
                 turn out to be a dog.


y k u   7 8 9   Move commands:
 \|/     \|/            yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
h-.-l   4-.-6           YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
 /|\     /|\                        hit a wall or run into something
b j n   1 2 3           g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
      numberpad                     interesting is seen
                        G<dir>,   same, except a branching corridor isn't
 <  up                  ^<dir>:     considered interesting (the ^ in this
                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)
 >  down                m<dir>:   move without picking up objects
                        F<dir>:   fight even if you don't sense a monster
                If the number_pad option is set, the number keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
                Digit '5' acts as 'G' prefix, unless number_pad is set to 2
                in which case it acts as 'g' instead.
                If number_pad is set to 3, the roles of 1,2,3 and 7,8,9 are
                reversed; when set to 4, behaves same as 3 combined with 2.
                If number_pad is set to -1, alphabetic movement commands are
                used but 'y' and 'z' are swapped.

Commands:
        NetHack knows the following commands:
        ?       Help menu.
        /       What-is, tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to
                specify a location or give a symbol argument.  Enabling the
                autodescribe option will give information about the symbol
                at each location you move the cursor onto.
        &       Tell what a command does.
        <       Go up a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        >       Go down a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        .       Rest, do nothing for one turn.
        _       Travel via a shortest-path algorithm to a point on the map.
        a       Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...).
        A       Remove all armor.
        ^A      Redo the previous command.
        c       Close a door.
        C       Call (name) monster, individual object, or type of object.
        d       Drop something.  d7a:  drop seven items of object a.
        D       Drop multiple items.  This command is implemented in two
                different ways.  One way is:
                "D" displays a list of all of your items, from which you can
                pick and choose what to drop.  A "+" next to an item means
                that it will be dropped, a "-" means that it will not be
                dropped.  Toggle an item to be selected/deselected by typing
                the letter adjacent to its description.  Select all items
                with "+", deselect all items with "=".  The <SPACEBAR> moves
                you from one page of the listing to the next.
                The other way is:
                "D" will ask the question "What kinds of things do you want
                to drop? [!%= au]".  You should type zero or more object
                symbols possibly followed by 'a' and/or 'u'.
                Da - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
                Du - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
                D%u - drop only unpaid food.
        ^D      Kick (for doors, usually).
        e       Eat food.
        E       Engrave a message on the floor.
                E- - write in the dust with your fingers.
        f       Fire ammunition from quiver.
        F       Followed by direction, fight a monster (even if you don't
                sense it).
        i       Display your inventory.
        I       Display selected parts of your inventory, as in
                I* - list all gems in inventory.
                Iu - list all unpaid items.
                Ix - list all used up items that are on your shopping bill.
                I$ - count your money.
        o       Open a door.
        O       Review current options and possibly change them.
                A menu displaying the option settings will be displayed
                and most can be changed by simply selecting their entry.
                Options are usually set before the game with NETHACKOPTIONS
                environment variable or via a configuration file (defaults.nh,
                NetHack Defaults, nethack.cnf, ~/.nethackrc, etc.) rather
                than with the 'O' command.
        p       Pay your shopping bill.
        P       Put on an accessory (ring, amulet, etc).
        ^P      Repeat last message (subsequent ^P's repeat earlier messages).
                The behavior can be varied via the msg_window option.
        q       Drink (quaff) something (potion, water, etc).
        Q       Select ammunition for quiver.
        #quit   Exit the program without saving the current game.
        r       Read a scroll or spellbook.

        t       Throw an object or shoot a projectile.
        T       Take off armor.
        ^T      Teleport, if you are able.

                history of the game.
        w       Wield weapon.  w- means wield nothing, use bare hands.

        #explore  Switch to Explore Mode (aka Discovery Mode) where dying and
                deleting the save file during restore can both be overridden.
        z       Zap a wand.  (Use y instead of z if number_pad is -1.)
        Z       Cast a spell.  (Use Y instead of Z if number_pad is -1.)
        ^Z      Suspend the game.  (^Y instead of ^Z if number_pad is -1.)

                [To resume play, terminate the shell subprocess via 'exit'.]
        #       Introduces one of the "extended" commands.  To get a list of
                the commands you can use with "#" type "#?".  The extended
                commands you can use depends upon what options the game was
                compiled with, along with your class and what type of monster
                you most closely resemble at a given moment.  If your keyboard
                has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination with another
                key, modifies it by setting the 'meta' (8th, or 'high') bit),
                these extended commands can be invoked by meta-ing the first
                letter of the command.  An alt key may have a similar effect.

        If the "number_pad" option is on, some additional letter commands
        are available:

        h       displays the help menu, like '?'
        j       Jump to another location.
        k       Kick (for doors, usually).
        l       Loot a box on the floor.
        n       followed by number of times to repeat the next command.
        N       Name a monster, an individual object, or a type of object.
        u       Untrap a trapped object or door.

        You can put a number before a command to repeat it that many times,
        as in "40." or "20s".  If you have the number_pad option set, you
        must type 'n' to prefix the count, as in "n40." or "n20s".


        Some information is displayed on the bottom line or perhaps in a
        box, depending on the platform you are using.  You see your
        attributes, your alignment, what dungeon level you are on, how many
        hit points you have now (and will have when fully recovered), what
        your armor class is (the lower the better), your experience level,
        and the state of your stomach.  Optionally, you may or may not see
        other information such as spell points, how much gold you have, etc.

        Have Fun, and Happy Hacking!

                Depending on the platform, Shift digit (on the numberpad),
                Meta digit, or Alt digit will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
                Digit '5' acts as 'G' prefix, unless number_pad is set to 2
                in which case it acts as 'g' instead.
                If number_pad is set to 3, the roles of 1,2,3 and 7,8,9 are
                reversed; when set to 4, behaves same as 3 combined with 2.
                If number_pad is set to -1, alphabetic movement commands are
                used but 'y' and 'z' are swapped.

General commands:
?     help      display one of several informative texts
#quit quit      end the game without saving current game
S     save      save the game (to be continued later) and exit
                [to restore, play again and use the same character name;
                use #quit to quit without saving]
!     sh        escape to some SHELL (if allowed; 'exit' to resume play)
^Z    suspend   suspend the game (independent of your current suspend char)
                [on UNIX(tm)-based systems, use the 'fg' command to resume]

&     what-does describe the command a keystroke invokes

Control characters are depicted as '^' followed by a letter.  Depress Ctrl
or Control like a shift key then type the letter.  Control characters are
case-insensitive; ^D is the same as ^d, Ctrl+d is same as Ctrl+Shift+d.
There are a few non-letter control characters; nethack uses ^[ as a synonym
for Escape (or vice versa) and ^_ for #retravel but none of the others.

                (for a monster on top of one or more objects, only describes
                that monster; for a pile of objects, only describes top one)

Keyboards that have a meta key (some use Alt for that, so typing Alt as a
shift plus 'e' would generate 'M-e') can also use these extended commands
via the meta modifier as an alternative to using the # prefix.  Unlike
control characters, meta characters are case-sensitive so M-a is different
from M-A.  Type the latter with two keys used as shifts, Meta+Shift+a.

If the 'number_pad' option is on, keys usually used for movement can be
used for various commands:

n               followed by number of times to repeat the next command
h     help      display one of several informative texts, like '?'

	Depending upon hardware or operating system or NetHack's interface,
	some keystrokes may be off-limits.

	For example, ^S and ^Q are often used for XON/XOFF flow-control,
	meaning that ^S suspends output and subsequent ^Q resumes suspended
	output.  When that is the case, neither of those characters will
	reach NetHack when it is waiting for a command keystroke.  So they
	aren't used as commands, but 'whatdoes' might not be able to tell
	you that if they don't get passed through to NetHack.

	^M or <return> or <enter> is likely to be transformed into ^J or
	<linefeed> or 'newline' before being passed to NetHack for handling.
	So it isn't used as a command, and 'whatdoes' might seem as if it
	is reporting the wrong character but will be operating correctly if
	it describes ^J when you type ^M.

	A NUL character, which is typed as ^<space> on some keyboards,
	^@ on others, and maybe not typeable at all on yet others, is not
	used as a command, and will be converted into ESC before reaching
	'whatdoes'.  Unlike ^M, this transformation is performed within
	NetHack.  But like ^M, if you type NUL and get feedback about ESC,
	the situation is expected.

	ESC itself is a synonym for ^[, and is another source of oddity.
	Various function keys, including cursor arrow keys, may transmit
	an "escape sequence" of ESC + [ + other stuff, confusing NetHack
	as to what command was intended since the ESC will be processed
	and then whatever follows will seem to NetHack like--and be used
	as--something typed by the user.  (If you press a function key and
	a menu of the armor your hero is wearing appears, what happened
	was that an escape sequence was sent to NetHack, its ESC aborted
	any pending key operation, its '[' was then treated as a command
	to show worn armor, and the "other stuff" probably got silently
	discarded as invalid choices while you dismissed the menu.)

	If you have NetHack's 'altmeta' option enabled, meaning that the
	<alt> or <option> key, when used as shift while typing some other
	character, transmits ESC and then the other character so NetHack
	should treat that other character as a meta-character, then ESC
	takes on added potential for confusion.  Implicit in the handling
	of a two character sequence ESC + something is the fact that when
	NetHack sees ESC, it needs to wait for another character before
	it can decide what to do.  So if you type ESC manually, you'll
	need to type it a second time or NetHack will sit there waiting.
	(It will then be treated as if you typed ESC rather than M-ESC.)

	On some systems, typing ^\ will send a QUIT signal to the current
	process, probably killing it and possibly causing it to save a
	core dump.  It is not used for any NetHack command, so don't type
	that character.

	One last note:  characters shown as ^x mean that you should hold
	down the <control> or <ctrl> key as a shift and then type 'x'.
	Control characters are all implicitly uppercase, but you don't
	need to press the shift key while typing them.  The opposite is
	true for meta-characters:  they can be either case, so you need
	to use shift as well as <meta> or <alt> to generate an uppercase
	letter meta-character.
NetHack History file for release 3.7

Behold, mortal, the origins of NetHack...

Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack, with help from Kenny Woodland,
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

Andries Brouwer did a major re-write while at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum
(now Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica), transforming Hack into a very different
game.  He published the Hack source code for use on UNIX(tm) systems by
posting that to Usenet newsgroup net.sources (later renamed comp.sources)
releasing version 1.0 in December of 1984, then versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2, and
finally 1.0.3 in July of 1985.  Usenet newsgroup net.games.hack (later
renamed rec.games.hack, eventually replaced by rec.games.roguelike.nethack)
was created for discussing it.

Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft(tm) C and MS-DOS(tm), producing
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and
went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6;
note that these are old Hack version numbers, not contemporary NetHack ones).

R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040ST,
producing ST Hack 1.03.

Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4 in 1987.  He
then coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4
and released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.  Like Hack, they were released by
posting their source code to Usenet where they remained available in various
archives accessible via ftp and uucp after expiring from the newsgroup.

Later, Mike coordinated a major re-write of the game, heading a team which
included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,
Izchak Miller, Eric S. Raymond, John Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz,
to produce NetHack 3.0c.

NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo
Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them and Kevin Darcy
later joined the main NetHack Development Team to produce subsequent
revisions of 3.0.

Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm Meluch, Stephen
Spackman and Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack 3.0.
Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other
Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports
through the later revisions of 3.0.

Version 3.0 went through ten relatively rapidly released "patch-level"
revisions.  Versions at the time were known as 3.0 for the base release
and variously as "3.0a" through "3.0j", "3.0 patchlevel 1" through
"3.0 patchlevel 10", or "3.0pl1" through "3.0pl10" rather than 3.0.0 and
3.0.1 through 3.0.10; the three component numbering scheme began to be used
with 3.1.0.

Headed by Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller and Janet Walz,
the NetHack Development Team which now included Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs,
Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major
parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
individual character quests, a new endgame and many other new features, and
produced NetHack 3.1.  Version 3.1.0 was released in January of 1993.

Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from Richard Addison,
Mike Passaretti, and Olaf Seibert, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Schelin, Stephen
Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

Jon W{tte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike Engber, David
Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke,
and Andy Swanson, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for
MPW.  Building on their development, Bart House added a Think C port.

Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith ported NetHack 3.1
to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from Joshua Delahunty, was responsible
for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to
Windows NT.

Dean Luick, with help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11.
It drew the map as text rather than graphically but included nh10.bdf, an
optionally used custom X11 font which has tiny images in place of letters and
punctuation, a precursor of tiles.  Those images don't extend to individual
monster and object types, just replacements for monster and object classes
(so one custom image for all "a" insects and another for all "[" armor and
so forth, not separate images for beetles and ants or for cloaks and boots).

Warwick Allison wrote a graphically displayed version of NetHack for the
Atari where the tiny pictures were described as "icons" and were distinct
for specific types of monsters and objects rather than just their classes.
He contributed them to the NetHack Development Team which rechristened them
"tiles", original usage which has subsequently been picked up by various
other games.  NetHack's tiles support was then implemented on other platforms
(initially MS-DOS but eventually Windows, Qt, and X11 too).

The 3.2 NetHack Development Team, comprised of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, Steve
Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz,
and Paul Winner, released version 3.2.0 in April of 1996.

Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of the development
team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all thirteen members
of the original NetHack Development Team remained on the team at the start
of work on that release.  During the interval between the release of 3.1.3
and 3.2.0, one of the founding members of the NetHack Development Team,
Dr. Izchak Miller, was diagnosed with cancer and passed away.  That release
of the game was dedicated to him by the development and porting teams.

Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.  Many bugs
were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better game
play.

During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusiasts of the game
added their own modifications to the game and made these "variants" publicly
available:

Tom Proudfoot and Yuval Oren created NetHack++, which was quickly renamed
NetHack-- when some people incorrectly assumed that it was a conversion
of the C source code to C++.  Working independently, Stephen White wrote
NetHack Plus.  Tom Proudfoot later merged NetHack Plus and his own NetHack--
to produce SLASH.  Larry Stewart-Zerba and Warwick Allison improved the
spell casting system with the Wizard Patch.  Warwick Allison also ported
NetHack to use the Qt interface.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH with the Wizard Patch to produce Slash'EM, and
with the help of Kevin Hugo, added more features.  Kevin later joined the
NetHack Development Team and incorporated the best of these ideas into
NetHack 3.3.

The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.
Because of the newer version, 3.2.3 was released as a source code patch only,
without any ready-to-play distribution for systems that usually had such.

(To anyone considering resurrecting an old version:  all versions before
3.2.3 had a Y2K bug.  The high scores file and the log file contained dates
which were formatted using a two-digit year, and 1999's year 99 was followed
by 2000's year 100.  That got written out successfully but it unintentionally
introduced an extra column in the file layout which prevented score entries
from being read back in correctly, interfering with insertion of new high
scores and with retrieval of old character names to use for random ghost and
statue names in the current game.)

The 3.3 NetHack Development Team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen,
Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.

Version 3.3 offered many firsts.  It was the first version to separate race
and profession.  The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race,
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues,
Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first
version to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a
publicly available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.
Despite that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last
for more than a year and a half.

The 3.4 NetHack Development Team initially consisted of Michael Allison,
Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick,
Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, with Warwick Allison
joining just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack runs on:

Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.
Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and enhanced the
Macintosh port of 3.4.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, and Yitzhak Sapir
maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform.  Alex Kompel
contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port.  Alex Kompel also
contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.

Ron Van Iwaarden was the sole maintainer of NetHack for OS/2 the past several
releases. Unfortunately Ron's last OS/2 machine stopped working in early
2006. A great many thanks to Ron for keeping NetHack alive on OS/2 all these
years.

Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced the
Amiga port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Christian "Marvin" Bressler maintained 3.4 for the Atari after he
resurrected it for 3.3.1.

The release of NetHack 3.4.3 in December 2003 marked the beginning of a
long release hiatus.  3.4.3 proved to be a remarkably stable version that
provided continued enjoyment by the community for more than a decade.  The
NetHack Development Team slowly and quietly continued to work on the game
behind the scenes during the tenure of 3.4.3.  It was during that same
period that several new variants emerged within the NetHack community.
Notably sporkhack by Derek S. Ray, unnethack by Patric Mueller, nitrohack
and its successors originally by Daniel Thaler and then by Alex Smith, and
Dynahack by Tung Nguyen.  Some of those variants continue to be developed,
maintained, and enjoyed by the community to this day.

In September 2014, an interim snapshot of the code under development was
released publicly by other parties.  Since that code was a work-in-progress
and had not gone through the process of debugging it as a suitable release,
it was decided that the version numbers present on that code snapshot would
be retired and never used in an official NetHack release.  An announcement
was posted on the NetHack Development Team's official nethack.org website
to that effect, stating that there would never be a 3.4.4, 3.5, or 3.5.0
official release version.

In January 2015, preparation began for the release of NetHack 3.6.

At the beginning of development for what would eventually get released
as 3.6.0, the NetHack Development Team consisted of Warwick Allison,
Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Ken Lorber,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.
In early 2015, ahead of the release of 3.6.0, new members Sean Hunt,
Pasi Kallinen, and Derek S. Ray joined the NetHack Development Team.

Near the end of the development of 3.6.0, one of the significant inspirations
for many of the humorous and fun features found in the game, author
Terry Pratchett, passed away.  NetHack 3.6.0 introduced a tribute to him.

3.6.0 was released in December 2015, and merged work done by the development
team since the release of 3.4.3 with some of the beloved community patches.
Many bugs were fixed and some code was restructured.

The NetHack Development Team, as well as Steve VanDevender and
Kevin Smolkowski, ensured that NetHack 3.6 continued to operate on various
UNIX flavors and maintained the X11 interface.

Ken Lorber, Haoyang Wang, Pat Rankin, and Dean Luick maintained the port
of NetHack 3.6 for MacOS.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Bart House, Pasi Kallinen, Alex Kompel,
Dion Nicolaas, Derek S. Ray and Yitzhak Sapir maintained the port of
NetHack 3.6 for Microsoft Windows.

Pat Rankin attempted to keep the VMS port running for NetHack 3.6,
hindered by limited access.  Kevin Smolkowski has updated and tested it
for the most recent version of OpenVMS (V8.4 as of this writing) on Alpha
and Integrity (aka Itanium aka IA64) but not VAX.

Ray Chason resurrected the MS-DOS port for 3.6 and contributed the
necessary updates to the community at large.

In late April 2018, several hundred bug fixes for 3.6.0 and some new
features were assembled and released as NetHack 3.6.1.
The NetHack Development Team at the time of release of 3.6.1 consisted of
Warwick Allison, Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet,
Pasi Kallinen, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Patric Mueller, Pat Rankin,
Derek S. Ray, Alex Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.

In early May 2019, another 320 bug fixes along with some enhancements and
the adopted curses window port, were released as 3.6.2.

Bart House, who had contributed to the game as a porting team participant
for decades, joined the NetHack Development Team in late May 2019.

NetHack 3.6.3 was released on December 5, 2019 containing over 190 bug
fixes to NetHack 3.6.2.

NetHack 3.6.4 was released on December 18, 2019 containing a security
fix and a few bug fixes.

NetHack 3.6.5 was released on January 27, 2020 containing some security fixes
and a small number of bug fixes.

NetHack 3.6.6 was released on March 8, 2020 containing a security fix and
some bug fixes.

NetHack 3.6.7 was released on February 16, 2023 containing a security fix and
some bug fixes.

There are further boolean options controlled by compilation flags.

Boolean option if INSURANCE was set at compile time:
checkpoint     save game state after each level change, for        [True]
               possible recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news           print any news from game administrator on startup   [True]

Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showscore      display your approximate accumulated score         [False]

Boolean option if TIMED_DELAY was set at compile time (tty or curses only):
timed_delay    on unix and VMS, use a timer instead of sending     [True]
               extra screen output when attempting to pause for
               display effect.  on MSDOS without the termcap
               lib, whether or not to pause for visual effect.

Boolean option if ALTMETA was set at compile time:
altmeta        For unix and VMS, treat two character sequence
               "ESC c" as M-c (Meta+c, 8th bit set) when nethack  [False]
               obtains a command from player's keyboard.

Boolean option if TILES_IN_GLYPHMAP set at compile time (MSDOS):
preload_tiles  control whether tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at    [True]
               the start of the game.  Doing so enhances performance
               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.

Boolean option if TTY_TILES_ESCCODES was set at compile time (tty only):
vt_tiledata    insert extra data escape code markers into output  [False]

Boolean option if TTY_SOUND_ESCCODES was set at compile time (tty only):
vt_sounddata   insert sound data escape code markers into output  [False]

Boolean options which may be available depending upon which interfaces
the program has been built to support.  If it supports multiple such,
some of these may show as available for setting but not do anything if
you happen to be using a different interface than the one(s) they're for:
ascii_map      show map as text, forces tiles_map Off; Qt, X11
guicolor       curses
hitpointbar    curses, tty, Windows GUI if statushilites enabled;
               Qt without statushilites; X11 if 'fancy_status' disabled
               (via X application defaults) and statushilities enabled
popup_dialog   curses, Qt, Windows GUI
selectsaved    tty (Qt and Windows GUI do this unconditionally)
splash_screen  curses, Qt, Windows GUI
tiled_map      show map as tiles, forces ascii_map Off; Qt, X11

Boolean options available when running in debug mode (aka wizard mode):
menu_tab_sep   menu formatting--do not touch
monpolycontrol have player choose shape-changing monsters' new shapes
montelecontrol let player choose destination for teleported monsters
travel_debug   show state of travel pathfinding algorithm on the map
wizweight      include item weights in inventory display

Any Boolean option can be set to True by including it among options being
set, or negated (set to False) by prefixing its name with a '!' or 'no'.
Alternatively, the compound option syntax can be used: 'optname:true' and
'optname:false'.

 - - - - -

Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

autounlock    when attempting to open a locked door or loot     [Apply-Key]
              a locked container, specifies an action to take: can be
              None, or one or more of Untrap + Apply-Key + Kick + Force;
              if Untrap is included, it will be handled first; the
              others apply if you answer "no" to "check for traps?";
              for "yes", it won't necessary find anything even when a
              trap happens to be present and will use up the rest of
              the current move regardless of whether it finds anything;
              Kick is only useful for doors and Force is only useful for
              containers; either will only be attempted if Untrap is
              omitted or skipped and Apply-Key is omitted or you aren't
              carrying an unlocking tool or you decline to use one

hilite_status specifies a rule for highlighting a status field           []
              (multiple instances are allowed)
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:      [Full]
              Traditional -- prompt for classes of interest, then
                             prompt item-by-item for those classes;

              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then item menu;
              Partial     -- skip class filtering, use menu of all items;
              only the first letter ('T','C','F','P') matters
              (With Traditional, many actions allow pseudo-class 'm' to
              request a menu for choosing items: one-shot Combination.)
menu_objsyms  whether to include object class symbols in menus:         [4]
              0 - none    -- don't add object symbols to menus;
              1 - headers -- append object class symbol to menu header lines;
              2 - entries -- show object glyphs (same as class symbol

              5 - one-or-other -- 1 and 4 combined;
              choices 0 and 1 should work with any interface; 2 through 5
              are supported by tty and curses
msg_window    behavior of ^P message recall for tty interface:          [s]
              single      -- one message at a time
              full        -- full window with all saved top line messages
              reverse     -- full with messages printed most-recent-first
              combination -- first two of consecutive ^P commands show
                             single messages, third yields full set
msg_window    behavior of ^P message recall for curses interface:       [r]
              reverse     -- full window, most recent first
              full        -- full with messages printed least recent first,

number_pad    alphabetic versus numeric control over movement:          [0]
               0 -- traditional hjkl + yubn movement (default);
               1 -- digits control movement, for use with numeric keypad;
               2 -- same as 1, but '5' works as 'g' prefix rather than 'G';
               3 -- numeric for phone keypad (1,2,3 above, 7,8,9 below);
               4 -- phone keypad (3) combined with '5' preference (2);
              -1 -- "qwertz"; alphabetic movement but 'z' swapped with 'y'.
              Setting number_pad (to a positive value) affects how all
              digit keys are handled, not just those on numeric keypad.
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of       [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              objects that gives the order in which your inventory (and
              some other things) gets shown if the 'sortpack' option is on
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)

                      hero has seen it and isn't impaired; on by default;
              AutoAll -- y to confirm if using menustyle:Full and choice 'A'
                      in the object class filtering menu is selected;
              Remove  -- always pick from inventory for 'R' and 'T' even when
                      wearing just one applicable item to remove or take off
perminv_mode  if the interface supports a persistent inventory window   [a]
              and the perm_invent option is true, this controls what
              will be shown:
              none/off -- behave as if perm_invent is false
              all/on   -- show inventory except for gold (default)
              full     -- show inventory including gold
              in-use   -- only show worn and wielded items
              (the tty interface's optional perm_invent support includes
              a couple of additional choices that vary all and full)
pickup_burden when you pick up an item that exceeds this encumbrance    [S]
              level (Unencumbered, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue.
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to          []
              autopickup when that option is on; empty list means "all"
pile_limit    for feedback when walking across floor objects,           [5]
              threshold at which "there are objects here" is displayed
              instead of listing them.  (0 means "always list objects.")
runmode       controls how often the map window is updated for        [run]
              multi-step movement (various running modes or travel command):
              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)
scores        the parts of the score list you wish    [!own/3 top/2 around]
              to see when the game ends.  You choose a combination of
              top scores, scores around the top scores, and all of your
              own scores.
sortdiscoveries preferred order when viewing list of discovered objects [o]
              o -- in order of discovery within each class

              a -- alphabetical, first any unique monsters then others
              c -- order by class, low to high level within each class
              n -- order by count, high to low
              z -- order by count, low to high
statushilites whether to display status highlights (when non-zero) and  [0]
              also how many turns to display temporary highlights (for
              'up', 'down', and 'changed' hilite_status rules)
statuslines   whether to use expanded (3) or condensed (2) status       [2]
              (for tty and curses; 2 is traditional, 3 is recommended;
              also for Qt, where 3 is traditional and 2 is recommended)
suppress_alert disable various version-specific warnings about changes   []
              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for the 'Q' command that quitting is now done via #quit
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:3.3.1 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier)
versinfo      selects what information is displayed when showvers  [1 or 4]
              is true (default depends on program development status)
whatis_coord  controls whether to include map coordinates when          [n]
              autodescribe is active for the '/' and ';' commands.
              Value is the first letter of one of
              compass      -- (relative to you; 'east' or '3s' or '2n,4w')
              full compass -- ('east' or '3south' or '2north,4west')
              map          -- <x,y>        (map column x=0 is not used)
              screen       -- [row,column] (row is offset to match tty usage)
              none         -- no coordinates shown.
whatis_filter controls how to filter eligible map coordinates when      [n]
              getting a map location for eg. the travel command.
              Value is the one of
              n - no filtering
              v - locations in view only
              a - locations in same area (room, corridor, etc)

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (lawful, neutral, chaotic,      [random]
           or random).  Many roles restrict the choice to a subset.
           You may specify just the first letter.
catname    name of your starting pet if it is a kitten               [none]
dogname    name of your starting pet if it is a little dog           [none]
           Several roles who start with a dog have one whose name is
           pre-set (for example, "Hachi" for Samurai), but that name
           will be overridden if you specify dogname.
gender     Your starting gender (male, female, or random).         [random]
           You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can
           still denote your gender using the old "male" and "female"
           boolean options, the "gender" option will take precedence.
horsename  name of your starting pet if it is a pony                 [none]
menu_*     specify single character accelerators for menu commands.
           Here is a list of all commands with their default keystroke
           followed by a list of window-ports that implement them:
           (t is tty, c is curses, w is Windows GUI, x is X11, q is Qt)
           menu_first_page    jump to the first page in a menu     [^](tcwxq)
           menu_last_page     jump to the last page in a menu      [|](tcwxq)
           menu_next_page     advance to the next menu page        [>](tcwxq)
           menu_previous_page back up to the previous menu page    [<](tcwxq)
           menu_shift_left    pan view to left (perm_invent only)  [{](cx)
           menu_shift_right   pan view to right (perm_invent only) [}](cx)
           menu_select_all    select all items in a menu           [.](tcwxq)
           menu_select_page   select all items on this menu page   [,](tcwq)
           menu_deselect_all  deselect all items in a menu         [-](tcwxq)
           menu_deselect_page deselect all items on this menu page [\](tcwq)
           menu_invert_all    invert all items in a menu           [@](tcwxq)
           menu_invert_page   invert all items on this menu page   [~](tcwq)
           menu_search        prompt for target text and invert    [:](tcwxq)
                              items which match that
msghistory number of top line messages to save                         [20]
name       the name of your character      [defaults to username on multi-
           user systems, asks "who are you?" on single-user systems or if
           the username is classified as generic like "games"]
           MS Windows is treated as single-user even though it supports
           usernames.  If character name is specified on the command
           line (typically via 'nethack -u myname' depending upon type
           of system and method of access to it), that name overrides
           'name' from your options.
pettype    your preferred type of pet (cat, dog, horse, random,    [random]
           or none), if your role allows more than one type (or if you
           want to avoid a starting pet).  Most roles allow dog or cat
           but not horse.  For roles which force a particular type,
           pettype is ignored unless it specifies 'none'.
playmode   normal play or non-scoring explore mode or debug mode   [normal]
race       Your starting race (e.g., race:Human, race:Elf).        [random]
           Most roles restrict race choice to a subset.
role       Your starting role (e.g., role:Barbarian, role:Valk).   [random]
           Although you can specify just the first letter(s), it will
           choose only the first role it finds that matches; thus, it
           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but
           the "role" option will take precedence.
windowtype windowing system to be used    [depends on operating system and
           compile-time setup]    if more than one choice is available.
           Some instances of the program support only one window-type;
           when that is the case, you don't need to specify anything.
           The list of supported window-types in your program can be
           seen while the program is running by using the #version
           command or from outside the program by examining the text file
           named 'options' which is generated when building it.

Some sample options lists are:
!autopickup,!tombstone,name:Gandalf,scores:own/3 top/2 around
female,nonews,dogname:Rover,rest_on_space,!verbose,menustyle:traditional
 How dynamically setting options works:

 The simple options menu shows a relatively small subset of options
 and operates on each choice you make immediately, then is put back
 up to allow further changes.

 The full options menu shows the current value for all options and
 lets you pick ones that you'd like to change.  Picking them doesn't
 make any changes though.  That will take place once you close the
 menu.  For most of NetHack's interfaces, closing the menu is done
 by pressing the <enter> key or <return> key; others might require
 clicking on [ok].  Pressing the <escape> key or clicking on [cancel]
 will close the menu and discard any pending changes.

 The options menu is too long to fit on one screen.  Some interfaces
 paginate menus; use the '>' key to advance a page or '<' to back
 up.  They typically re-use selection letters (a-z) on each page.
 Others use one long page and you need to use a scrollbar; once past
 a-z and A-Z they'll have entries without selection letters.  Those
 can be selected by clicking on them.

 For toggling boolean (True/False or On/Off) options, selecting them
 is all that is needed.  For compound options (which take a number,
 a choice of several particular values, or something more complex,
 and are listed in a second section after the boolean ones), you will
 be prompted to supply a new value.

 At the start of each of the two sections are the values of some
 unselectable options which can only be set before the game starts.
 After the compound section are some "other" options which take a set
 of multiple values and tend to be more complicated to deal with.

 Some changes will only last until you save (or quit) the current
 game.  Usually those are for things that might not be appropriate
 if you were to restore the saved game on another computer with
 different capabilities.  Other options will be included in this
 game's save file and retain their settings after restore.  None set
 in the options menu will affect other games, either already saved or
 new ones.  For that, you need to update your run-time configuration
 file and specify the desired options settings there.  Even then,
 restoring existing games that contain saved option values will use
 those saved ones.

This is a terse description of nethack's command line arguments.
It is oriented toward UNIX (including descendants such as linux and macOS)
and might not be accurate for other platforms.

When starting play, if there is a save file for the chosen character name
then it will be restored, otherwise a new game using that name will begin.

nethack
  with no arguments; uses character name from run-time configuration file's
  OPTIONS=name:character-name entry, or player's username if none.

nethack -u character-name [-X or -D]
  '-u character-name' specifies the name to use for this game's character;
       -u must be lowercase; the space between it and character-name may
       be omitted;
  '-X' play in non-scoring explore mode also known as discovery mode;
       -X must be uppercase; character starts with a wand of wishing and
       player may opt to be life-saved and keep going if character dies;
  '-D' run in debug mode also known as wizard mode; -D must be uppercase;
       if player is not allowed then nethack will switch to -X; if player
       is allowed, character name will be changed to "wizard".

  A character name may have a suffix specifying any or all of role, race,
  gender, and alignment such as -u Conan-Bar-Hum-Mal-Neu or -u Tim-Wiz.
  The components present must be at least three letters long but can be
  longer; their case doesn't matter.  See also -p and -r, next,

nethack -p Ppp -r Rrr [-@]
  '-p Ppp' specify role; p for "profession" is used because -r is in use;
       'Ppp' is three or more letters of the role name such as Val for
       Valkyrie; unlike -p itself, upper/lower case of Ppp doesn't matter
  '-r Rrr' specify race or species: Hum[an], Elf, Orc, Dwa[rf], Gno[me];
  '-@' force non-interactive start; any of role, race, gender, and
       alignment that is not specified on the command line or in the
       run-time configuration file gets chosen randomly without prompting;
       the at-sign might need to be quoted by preceding it with backslash.

  The old form for role is also still accepted:  -A or -Arc[heologist],
  -B or -Bar[barian], -C or -Cav[eman] or -Cavew[oman], -H or -Hea[ler],
  -K or -Kni[ght], -M or -Mon[k], -P or -Pri[est] or -Prieste[ss],
  -Ran[ger], -R or -Rog[ue], -S or -Sam[urai], -T or -Tou[rist],
  -V or -Val[kyrie], -W or -Wiz[ard].  The single-letter form must be in
  uppercase, the three or more letter form can be in any case.  There is
  no single-letter option for the Ranger role.

nethack -DEC[graphics]
nethack -IBM[graphics]
  selects the DEC or IBM symbol set to use line-drawing characters on a
  text map; might be ignored depending on interface, or ineffective or
  even scrambled depending on display capability; -DECgraphics and
  -IBMgraphics are mutually exclusive; they can be any case but must use
  at least three letters.

nethack -wIii
nethack --windowtype:Iii
  where 'Iii' represents an interface designation:  tty, curses, X11, or
  Qt; only useful if the program was built to support more than one
  interface (the game's '#version' command will disclose that); overrides
  OPTIONS=windowtype:Iii in run-time configuration file and build-time
  default; '-w' or '--windowtype' must be lowercase, the interface
  designation itself may be any case; variations '--windowtype Iii' and
  '-w Iii' work too.

  On Windows, nethack.exe supports tty or curses or both depending on
  settings at the time the program is built from source; nethackW.exe
  supports mswin (also referred to as Win GUI) and optionally curses.
  For MS-DOS, the program supports tty or curses or both.

nethack -n
  don't show the 'news' file if one is present in nethack's directory.

nethack --nethackrc:RC-file
  use RC-file instead of the default run-time configuration file (which is
  usually '~/.nethackrc'); the file name should include full path unless
  located in nethack's directory;
nethack --no-nethackrc
  don't use any run-time configuration file; equivalent to
  --nethackrc:/dev/null which behaves as if an empty file.

nethack -dDir
nethack --directory:Dir
  could be used to override the build-time value of NETHACKDIR with
  location Dir; if used, it should precede other command line arguments.

The assorted options above can be combined on a single command line;
they're listed separately for readability.

*******

Other options which perform some action and then exit rather than play
the game:

nethack -s
nethack --scores
  show scores for the default character; optional additional arguments:
nethack -s -v
  show scores for all versions present in the high scores file (record)
  if it contains scores for any older versions; by default, only scores
  for current version of nethack are shown; when '-v' is used, it should
  immediately follow -s or --scores, preceding any name(s) or -p or -r;
nethack -s character-name [character-name2 [character-name3 [...]]]
  show scores for one or more specific character names (might not be
  effective if PERS_IS_UID=1 is specified in nethack's sysconf file);
  character names may be preceded by '-u' but that isn't required;
  special character-name "all" is used to display all scores that pass
  other criteria;
nethack -s -p Ppp -r Rrr
  show scores for specific roles or races; multiple instances can be used;
  if both '-p' and '-r' are used, scores that match either will be shown
  rather than scores that match both;
nethack -dDir -s
nethack --directory:Dir -s
  as above; alternate directory, if specified, should come first.

nethack --version or --version:copy or --version:dump or --version:show
  '--version' display the program's version number plus the date and
  time it was built from source code, then exit;
  '--version:copy' display version number and also copy it into system
  pasteboard (should work on macOS and Windows; might not work on other
  systems) so that it could be pasted from there into a subsequent email
  or web contact form, then exit;
  '--version:dump' display several internal values, then exit;
  '--version:show' same as '--version'.

nethack --showpaths
  list expected locations for various files and directories, then exit;
  includes the name and location for the run-time configuration file which
  can vary from platform to platform.

nethack --usage
nethack --help
  show this text; 'nethack -?' and 'nethack ?' also work but the question
  mark may need to be quoted to prevent the shell from intercepting it.

*******

This text is available during play in the menu for the game's '?' command
or can be viewed via 'nethack --usage | more' at the shell prompt.

%title The Colour of Magic  (14)
# p. 67 (Signet edition; 'Morpork':  initially Ankh and Morpork were twin
#        cities with distinct characteristics on opposite sides of the Ankh
#        river--they were eventually consolidated into Ankh-Morpork without
#        regard to which area was where)
%passage 1
It has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiations in
the far octarine--the eighth colour, the pigment of the Imagination--can
see things that others cannot.

Thus it was that Rincewind, hurrying through the crowded, flare-lit,
evening bazaars of Morpork with the Luggage trundling behind him, jostled
a tall dark figure, turned to deliver a few suitable curses, and beheld
Death.

It had to be Death.  No-one else went around with empty eye sockets and,
of course, the scythe over one shoulder was another clue.  [...]

  [The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett]
%e passage 1
# p. 116
%passage 2
As he was drawn towards the Eye the terror-struck Rincewind raised the box
protectively, and at the same time heard the picture imp say, "They're
about ripe now, can't hold them any longer.  Everyone smile, please."

There was a--
--flash of light so white and so bright--
--it didn't seem like light at all.

Bel-Shamharoth screamed, a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and
finished somewhere in Rincewind's bowels.  The tentacles went momentarily
as stiff as rods, hurling their various cargoes around the room, before
bunching up protectively in front of the abused Eye.  The whole mass
dropped into the pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by
several dozen tentacles and slammed into place, leaving a number of
thrashing limbs trapped around the edge.

# p. 8 (passage starts mid-paragraph)
%passage 3
[...]  In the meantime, they could only speculate about the revealed
cosmos.

There was, for example, the theory that A'Tuin had come from nowhere and
would continue at a uniform crawl, or steady gait, into nowhere, for all
time.  This theory was popular among academics.

An alternative, favoured by those of a religious persuasion, was that
A'Tuin was crawling from the Birthplace to the Time of Mating, as were
all the stars in the sky which were, obviously, also carried by giant
turtles.  When they arrived they would briefly and passionately mate, for
the first and only time, and from that fiery union new turtles would be
born to carry a new pattern of worlds.  This was known as the Big Bang
hypothesis.

%e passage
# p. 13 (end of a long footnote; the initial obsession with 'eight' ended
#        fairly quickly within the Discworld series)
%passage 4
[...]

There are, of course, eight days in a disc week and eight colours in its
light spectrum.  Eight is a number of some considerable occult
significance on the disc and must never, ever, be spoken by a wizard.

Precisely why all the above should be so is not clear, but goes some way
to explain why, on the disc, the Gods are not so much worshipped as blamed.

"I assure you the thought never even crossed my mind, lord."

"Indeed?  Then if I were you I'd sue my face for slander."

# p. 41 (title of 5th book is "Sourcery" but it's spelled "sorcery" here;
#        'organising': British spelling)
%passage 6
All the heroes of the Circle Sea passed through the gates of Ankh-Morpork
sooner or later.  Most of them were from the barbaric tribes nearer the
frozen Hub, which had a sort of export trade in heroes.  Almost all of
them had crude magic swords, whose unsuppressed harmonics on the astral
plane played hell with any delicate experiments in applied sorcery for
miles around, but Rincewind didn't object to them on that score.  He knew
himself to be a magical dropout, so it didn't bother him that the mere
appearance of a hero at the city gates was enough to cause retorts to
explode and demons to materialize all through the Magical Quarter.  No,
what he didn't like about heroes was that they were usually suicidally
gloomy when sober and homicidally insane when drunk.  There were too many
of them, too.  Some of the most notable questing grounds were a veritable
hubbub in the season.  There was talk of organising a rota.

# pp. 82-83 (passage starts mid-paragraph;
#            pronouns for deities are not capitalized;
#            Bravd and the Weasel, obviously a parody of Fritz Leiber's
#            Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, appear at the beginning of the 1st
#            of 4 stories and then are left behind, never to be seen again;
#            "wenegrade wiffard" is Rincewind and "fome fort of clerk" is
#            Twoflower the tourist; the seemingly abrupt end of the passage
#            is the end of the 2nd of the 4 stories that make up the book;

%passage 7
[...]  The disc gods themselves, despite the splendor of the world below
them, are seldom satisfied.  It is embarrassing to know that one is a god
of a world that only exists because every improbability curve must have
its far end; especially when one can peer into other dimensions at worlds
whose Creators had more mechanical aptitude than imagination.  No wonder,
then, that the disc gods spend more time bickering than in omnicognizance.

On this particular day Blind Io, by dint of constant vigilance the chief
of the gods, sat with his chin on his hand and looked at the gaming board
on the red marble table in front of him.  Blind Io had got his name
because, where his eye sockets should have been, there were nothing but
two areas of blank skin.  His eyes, of which he had an impressively large
number, led a semi-independent life of their own.  Several were currently
hovering above the table.

The gaming board was a carefully-carved map of the disc world, overprinted
with squares.  A number of beautifully modelled playing pieces were now
occupying some of the squares.  A human onlooker would, for example, have
recognized in two of them the likenesses of Bravd and the Weasel.  Others
represented yet more heroes and champions, of which the disc had a more
than adequate supply.

Still in the game were Io, Offler the Crocodile God, Zephyrus the god of
slight breezes, Fate, and the Lady.  There was an air of concentration
around the board now that the lesser players had been removed from the
Game.  Chance had been an early casualty, running her hero into a full
house of armed gnolls (the result of a lucky throw by Offler) and shortly
afterwards Night had cashed his chips, pleading an appointment with
Destiny.  Several minor deities had drifted up and were kibitzing over
the shoulders of the players.

Side bets were made that the Lady would be the next to leave the board.
Her last champion of any standing was now a pinch of potash in the ruins
of still-smoking Ankh-Morpork, and there were hardly any pieces that she
could promote to first rank.

Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various orifices
had been stoppered with rubies, and with several of his eyes on the Lady
he rolled three fives.

She smiled.  This was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright
green, lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and, from the
very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on the board with two
decisive clicks.  The rest of the players, as one God, craned forward to
peer at them.

"A wenegrade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the Crocodile
God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well, weally!"  With one claw he
pushed a pile of bone-white tokens into the centre of the table.

The Lady nodded slightly.  She picked up the dice-cup and held it as steady
as a rock, yet all the gods could hear the three cubes rattling about
inside.  And then she sent them bouncing across the table.

A six.  A three.  A five.

Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the chance
collision of several billion molecules, the die flipped onto a point, spun
gently and came down a seven.

Blind Io picked up the cube and counted the sides.

"Come /on/," he said wearily.  "Play fair."

Picturesque.  That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard (B. Mgc.,
Unseen University [failed]).  It was one of a number he had picked up
since leaving the charred ruins of Ankh-Morpork.  Quaint was another one.
Picturesque meant--he decided after careful observation of the scenery
that inspired Twoflower to use the word--that the landscape was horribly
precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the occasional village through
which they passed, meant fever-ridden and tumbledown.

Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld.  Tourist,
Rincewind decided, meant "idiot."

%passage 9
Currently Twoflower was showing a great interest in the theory and practice
of magic.

"It all seems, well, rather useless to me," he said.  "I always thought
that, you know, a wizard just said the words and that was that.  Not all
this tedious memorising."

Rincewind agreed moodily.  He tried to explain that magic had indeed once
been wild and lawless, but had been tamed back in the mists of time by the
Olden Ones, who had bound it to obey among other things the Law of
Conservation of Reality; this demanded that the effort needed to achieve
a goal should be the same regardless of the means used.  In practical
terms, this meant that, say, creating the illusion of a glass of wine was
relatively easy, since it involved merely the subtle shifting of light
patterns.  On the other hand, lifting a genuine wineglass a few feet in
the air by sheer mental energy required several hours of systematic
preparation if the wizard wished to prevent the simple principle of
leverage flicking his brain out through his ears.

He went on to add that some of the ancient magic could still be found in
its raw state, recognizable--to the initiated--by the eightfold shape it
made in the crystalline structure of space-time.  There was the metal
octiron, for example, and the gas octogen.  Both radiated dangerous
amounts of raw enchantment.

A large, but not particularly impressive, book.  Other books in the
University's libraries had covers inlaid with rare jewels and fascinating
wood, or bound with dragon skin.  This one was just a rather tatty leather.

The man on his right thoughtfully drank his cocktail of mare's milk and
snowcat blood, and spoke thus:  "The crisp horizon of the steppe, the wind
in your hair, a fresh horse under you."

The man on his left said:  "The cry of the white eagle in the heights, the
fall of snow in the forest, a true arrow in your bow."

The chieftain nodded and said:  "Surely it is the sight of your enemy
slain, the humiliation of his tribe and the lamentation of his women."

There was a general murmur of whiskery approval at this outrageous display.

Then the chieftain turned respectfully to his guest, a small figure
carefully warming his chilblains by the fire, and said:  "But our guest,
whose name is legend, must tell us truly:  what is it that a man may call

The guest paused in the middle of another unsuccessful attempt to light up.

"What shay?" he said, toothlessly.

"I said:  what is it that a man may call the greatest things in life?"

%passage 10
There have been three general theories put forward to explain the
phenomenon of the wandering shops, or as they are generically known,
/tabernae vagantes/.

The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there evolved
somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent was to buy cheap
and sell dear.  Soon they controlled a vast galactic empire or, as they put
it, Emporium, and the more advanced members of the species found a way to
equip their very shops with unique propulsion units that could break the
dark walls of space itself and open up vast new markets.  And long after
the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of their particular
universe, after one last defiant fire sale, the wandering starshops still
ply their trade, eating their way through the pages of space-time like a
worm through a three-volume novel.

The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate, charged
with the role of supplying exactly the right thing at the right time.

The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting around the
various Sunday Closing acts.

All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in common.  They
explain the observed facts, and they are completely and utterly wrong.

Rincewind stared, and knew that there were far worse things than Evil.  All
the demons in Hell would torture your very soul, but that was precisely
because they value souls very highly; evil would always try to steal the
universe, but at least it considered the universe worth stealing.  But the
grey world behind those empty eyes would trample and destroy without even

Animal minds are simple, and therefore sharp.  Animals never spend time
dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits
they've missed.  The whole panoply of the universe has been neatly
expressed to them as things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from,
and (d) rocks.  This frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives
it a cutting edge where it matters.  Your normal animal, in fact, never
tries to walk and chew gum at the same time.

The average human, on the other hand, thinks about all sorts of things
around the clock, on all sorts of levels, with interruptions from dozens
of biological calendars and timepieces.  There's thoughts about to be said,
and private thoughts, and real thoughts, and thoughts about thoughts, and
a whole gamut of subconscious thoughts.  To a telepath the human head is
a din.  It is a railway terminus with all the Tannoys talking at once.

The town was smaller than Ohulan, and very different because it lay on the
junction of three trade routes quite apart from the river itself.  It was
built around one enormous square which was a cross between a permanent
exotic traffic jam and a tent village.  Camels kicked mules, mules kicked
horses, horses kicked camels and they all kicked humans; there was a riot
of colours, a din of noise, a nasal orchestration of smells and the steady,
heady sound of hundreds of people working hard at making money.

One reason for the bustle was that over large parts of the continent other
people preferred to make money without working at all, and since the Disc
had yet to develop a music recording industry they were forced to fall back
on older, more traditional forms of banditry.

Strangely enough these often involved considerable effort.  Rolling heavy
rocks to the top of cliffs for a decent ambush, cutting down trees to
block the road, and digging a pit lined with spikes while still keeping a
wicked edge on a dagger probably involved a much greater expenditure of
thought and muscle than more socially-acceptable professions but,
nevertheless, there were still people misguided enough to endure all this,
plus long nights in uncomfortable surroundings, merely to get their hands

So a town like Zemphis was the place where caravans split, mingled and
came together again, as dozens of merchants and travellers banded together
for protection against the socially disadvantaged on the trails ahead.
Esk, wandering unregarded amidst the bustle, learned all this by the simple
method of finding someone who looked important and tugging on the hem of
his coat.

This particular man was counting bales of tobacco and would have succeeded
but for the interruption.

"What?"

"I said, what is happening here?"

The man meant to say:  "Push off and bother someone else."  He meant to
give her a light cuff about the head.  So he was astonished to find himself
bending down and talking seriously to a small, grubby-faced child holding
a large broomstick (which also, it seemed to him later, was in some
indefinable way /paying attention/).

He explained about the caravans.  The child nodded.

"People all get together to travel?"

"Precisely."

"Where to?"

"All sorts of places.  Sto Lat, Pseudopolis... Ankh-Morpork, of course...."

"But the river goes there," said Esk, reasonably.  "Barges.  The Zoons."

"Ah, yes," said the merchant, "but they charge high prices and they can't
carry everything and, anyway, no one trusts them much."

"But they're very honest!"

"Huh, yes," he said.  "But you know what they say:  never trust an honest
man."  He smiled knowingly.

"Who says that?"

"They do.  You know.  People," he said, a certain uneasiness entering his
voice.

"Oh," said Esk.  She thought about it.  "They must be very silly," she said
primly.  "Thank you, anyway."

The broomstick lay between two trestles.  Granny Weatherwax sat on a rock
outcrop while a dwarf half her height, wearing an apron that was a mass of
pockets, walked around the broom and occasionally poked it.

Eventually he kicked the bristles and gave a long intake of breath, a sort
of reverse whistle, which is the secret sign of craftsman across the
universe and means that something expensive is about to happen.

"Weellll," he said.  "I could get the apprentices in to look at this, I
could.  It's an education in itself.  And you say it actually managed to
get airborne?"

"It flew like a bird," said Granny.

The dwarf lit a pipe.  "I should very much like to see that bird," he said
reflectively.  "I should imagine it's quite something to watch, a bird like
that."

"Yes, but can you repair it?" said Granny.  "I'm in a hurry."

The dwarf sat down, slowly and deliberately.

"As for /repair/," he said, "well, I don't know about /repair/.  Rebuild,
maybe.  Of course, it's hard to get the bristles these days even if you can
find people to do the proper binding, and the spells need--"

"I don't want it rebuilt, I just want it to work properly," said Granny.

"It's an early model, you see," the dwarf plugged on.  "Very tricky, those
early models.  You can't get the wood--"

He was picked up bodily until his eyes were level with Granny's.  Dwarves,
being magical in themselves as it were, are quite resistant to magic but
her expression looked as though she was trying to weld his eyeballs to the
back of his skull.

"Just repair it," she hissed.  "Please?"

"What, make a bodge job?" said the dwarf, his pipe clattering to the floor.

"Yes."

"Patch it up, you mean?  Betray my training by doing half a job?"

"Yes," said Granny.  Her pupils were two little black holes.

"Oh," said the dwarf.  "Right, then."

Mort was getting interested in the rock.  It had curly shells in it, relics
of the early days of the world when the Creator had made creatures out of
stone, no-one knew why.

Mort was interested in lots of things.  Why people's teeth fitted together
so neatly, for example.  He'd given that one a lot of thought.  Then there
was the puzzle of why the sun came out during the day, instead of at night
when the light would come in useful.  He knew the standard explanation,
which somehow didn't seem satisfying.

In short, Mort is one of those people who are more dangerous than a bag
full of rattlesnakes.  He was determined to discover the underlying logic
behind the universe.

Which was going to be hard, because there wasn't one.  The Creator had a
lot of remarkably good ideas when he put the world together, but making it
understandable hadn't been one of them.

"Yes," said Mort slowly.  "I... I've watched people.  They look at you but
they don't see you, I think.  You do something to their minds."

Death shook his head.

THEY DO IT ALL THEMSELVES, he said.  THERE'S NO MAGIC.  PEOPLE CAN'T SEE ME,
THEY SIMPLY WON'T ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DO IT.  UNTIL IT'S TIME, OF COURSE.

They were on the roof before he spoke again.

YOU TRIED TO WARN HIM, he said, removing Binky's nosebag.

"Yes, sir.  Sorry."

YOU CANNOT INTERFERE WITH FATE.  WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE WHO SHOULD LIVE AND
WHO SHOULD DIE?

Death watched Mort's expression carefully.

ONLY THE GODS ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT, he added.  TO TINKER WITH THE FATE OF
EVEN ONE INDIVIDUAL COULD DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

Mort nodded miserably.

"Are you going to send me home?" he said.

Death reached down and swung him up behind the saddle.

%passage 6
"I'm no demon!  I'm a human!" he said, and stopped in shock as his words
emerged in perfect Klatch.

"You're a thief?" said the father.  "A murderer?  To creep in thus, are you
a /tax-gatherer/?"  His hand slipped under the table and came up holding a
meat cleaver honed to paper thinness.  His wife screamed and dropped the
plate and clutched the youngest children to her.

Mort watched the blade weave through the air, and gave in.

"I bring you greetings from the uttermost circles of hell," he hazarded.

The change was remarkable.  The cleaver was lowered and the family broke
into broad smiles.

"There is much luck to us if a demon visits," beamed the father.  "What is
your wish, O foul spawn of Offler's loins?"

"Sorry?" said Mort.

"A demon brings blessing and good fortune on the man that helps it," said
the man.  "How may we be of assistance, O evil dogsbreath of the nether
pit?"

"Well, I'm not very hungry," said Mort, "but if you know where I can get a
fast horse, I could be in Sto Lat before sunset."

The man beamed and bowed.  "I know the very place, noxious extrusion of the
bowels, if you would be so good as to follow me."

Mort hurried out after him.  The ancient ancestor watched them go with a
critical expression, its jowls rhythmically chewing.

"That was what they call a demon around here?" it said.  "Offler rot this
country of dampness, even their demons are third-rate, not a patch on the
demons we had in the Old Country."

The wife placed a small bowl of rice in the folded middle pair of hands of
the Offler statue (it would be gone in the morning) and stood back.

"Husband did say that last month at the /Curry Gardens/ he served a creature
who was not there," she said.  "He was impressed."

Ten minutes later the man returned and, in solemn silence, placed a small
heap of gold coins on the table.  They represented enough wealth to
purchase quite a large part of the city.

"He had a bag of them," he said.

The family stared at the money for some time.  The wife sighed.

"Riches bring many problems," she said.  "What are we to do?"

"We return to Klatch," said the husband firmly, "where our children can grow
up in a proper country, true to the glorious traditions of our ancient race
and men do not need to work as waiters for wicked masters but can stand tall
and proud.  And we must leave right now, fragrant blossom of the date palm."

"Why so soon, O hard-working son of the desert?"

"Because," said the man, "I have just sold the Patrician's champion
racehorse."

Death raised his skull and sniffed the air.

The sound cut through all the other noises in the hall and forced them
into silence.

It is the kind of noise that is heard on the twilight edges of dreams,
the sort that you wake from in the cold sweat of mortal horror.  It was
the snuffling under the door of dread.  It was like the snuffling of a
hedgehog, but if so then it was the kind of hedgehog that crashes out of

"Well, that was a lesson to all of us," the bursar continued, brushing dust
and candle wax off his robe.  He looked up, expecting to see the statue of
Alberto Malich back on its pedestal.

"Clearly even statues have feelings," he said.  "I myself recall, when I
was but a first-year student, writing my name on his... well, never mind.
The point is, I propose here and now we replace the statue."

Dead silence greeted this suggestion.

"With, say, an exact likeness cast in gold.  Suitably embellished with
jewels, as befits our great founder," he went on brightly.

"And to make sure no students deface it in any way I suggest we then erect
it in the deepest cellar," he continued.

"And then lock the door," he added.  Several wizards began to cheer up.

"And throw away the key?" said Rincewind.

"And /weld/ the door," the bursar said.  He had just remembered about The
Mended Drum.  He thought for a while and remembered about the physical
fitness regime as well.

"And then brick up the doorway," he said.  There was a round of applause.

"And throw away the brick layer!" chortled Rincewind, who felt he was
getting the hang of this.

The bursar scowled at him.  "No need to get carried away," he said.

The thief, as will become apparent, was a special type of thief.  This
thief was an artist of theft.  Other thieves merely stole everything that
was not nailed down, but this thief stole the nails as well.  This thief
had scandalised Ankh by taking a particular interest in stealing, with
astonishing success, things that were in fact not only nailed down but
also guarded by keen-eyed guards in inaccessible strongrooms.  There are
artists that will paint an entire chapel ceiling; this was the kind of
thief that could steal it.

This particular thief was credited with stealing the jeweled disemboweling
knife from the temple of Offler the Crocodile God during the middle of
Evensong, and the silver shoes from the Patrician's finest racehorse
while it was in the process of winning a race.  When Gritoller Mimpsey,
vice-president of the Thieves' Guild, was jostled in the marketplace and
then found on returning home that a freshly-stolen handful of diamonds
had vanished from their place of concealment, he knew who to blame.(1)
This was the type of thief that could steal the initiative, the moment
and the words out of your mouth.

(1) This was because Gritoller had swallowed the jewels for safe keeping.

It was deathly quiet in the Library.  The books were no longer frantic.
They'd passed through their fear and out into the calm waters of abject
terror, and they crouched on their shelves like so many mesmerised rabbits.

A long hairy arm reached up and grabbed /Casplock's Compleet Lexicon of
Majik and Precepts for the Wise/ before it could back away, soothed its
terror with a long-fingered hand, and opened it under 'S'.  The Librarian
smoothed the trembling page gently and ran a horny nail down the entries
until he came to:

    *Sourceror*, /n. (mythical).  A proto-wizard, a doorway through/
    /which new majik may enterr the world, a wizard not limited by/
    /the physycal capabilities of hys own bodie, not by Destinie,/
    /nor by Deathe.  It is written that there once werre sourcerors/
    /in the youth of the world but not may there by nowe and blessed/
    /be, for sourcery is not for menne and the return of sourcery/
    /would mean the Ende of the Worlde...  If the Creator hadd meant/
    /menne to bee as goddes, he ould have given them wings./
    /SEE ALSO:  thee Apocralypse, the legende of thee Ice Giants,/
    /and thee Teatime of the Goddes./

The Librarian read the cross-references, turned back to the first entry,
and stared at it through deep dark eyes for a long time.  Then he put the
book back carefully, crept under his desk, and pulled the blanket over
his head.

The current Patrician, head of the extremely rich and powerful Vetinari
family, was thin, tall and apparently as cold-blooded as a dead penguin.
Just by looking at him you could tell he was the sort of man you'd expect
to keep a white cat, and caress it idly while sentencing people to death
in a piranha tank; and you'd hazard for good measure that he probably
collected rare, thin porcelain, turning it over and over in his blue-white
fingers while distant screams echoed from the depths of the dungeons.  You
wouldn't put it past him to use the word "exquisite" and have thin lips.
He looked the kind of person who, when they blinked, you mark it off on
the calendar.

Practically none of this was in fact the case, although he did have a small
and exceedingly elderly wire-haired terrier called Wuffles that smelled
badly and wheezed at people.  It was said to be the only thing in the
entire world he truly cared about.  He did of course sometimes have people
horribly tortured to death, but this was considered to be perfectly
acceptable behaviour for a civic ruler and generally approved of by the
overwhelming majority of citizens.(1)  The people of Ankh are of a
practical persuasion, and felt that the Patrician's edict forbidding all
street theatre and mime artists made up for a lot of things.  He didn't
administer a reign of terror, just the occasional light shower.

everyone not currently hanging upside down over a scorpion pit.

The astro-philosophers of Krull once succeeded in proving conclusively
that all places are one place and that the distance between them is an
illusion, and this news was an embarrassment to all thinking philosophers
because it did not explain, among other things, signposts.  After years of
wrangling the whole thing was then turned over to Ly Tin Wheedle, arguably
the Disc's greatest philosopher,(1) who after some thought proclaimed that
although it was indeed true that all places were one place, that place was
/very large/.

And so psychic order was restored.  Distance is, however, an entirely
subjective phenomenon and creatures of magic can adjust it to suit
themselves.

They are not necessarily very good at it.

[...] killing a brother wizard with magic was well-nigh impossible on
account of the layers of protective spells that any cautious wizard
maintained about his person at all times.(1)  The first thing a young
wizard learns at Unseen University--apart from where his peg is, and
which way to the lavatory--is that he must protect himself at all times.

Some people think this is paranoia, but it isn't.  Paranoids only think
everyone is out to get them.  Wizards /know/ it.

(1) Of course, wizards often killed one another by ordinary, non-magical
means, but this was perfectly allowable and death by assassination was
considered natural causes for a wizard.

Verence tried to avoid walking through walls.  A man had his dignity.

He became aware that he was being watched.

He turned his head.

There was a cat sitting in the doorway, subjecting him to a slow blink.  It
was a mottled grey and extremely fat...

No.  It was extremely /big/.  It was covered with so much scar tissue that
it looked like a fist with fur on it.  Its ears were a couple of perforated
stubs, its eyes two yellow slits of easy-going malevolence, its tail a
twitching series of question marks as it stared at him.

Greebo had heard that Lady Felmet had a small white female cat and had
strolled up to pay his respects.

Verence had never seen an animal with so much built-in villainy.  He didn't
resist as it waddled across the floor and dried to rub itself against his
legs, purring like a waterfall.

"Well, well," said the king, vaguely.  He reached down and made an effort
to scratch it behind the two ragged bits on top of its head.   It was a
relief to find someone else besides another ghost who could see him, and
Greebo, he couldn't help feeling, was a distinctly unusual cat.  Most of
the castle cats were either pampered pets or flat-eared kitchen and stable
habitues who generally resembled the very rodents they lived on.  This cat,
on the other hand, was its own animal.  All cats give that impression, of
course, but instead of the mindless animal self-absorption that passes for
secret wisdom in the creatures, Greebo radiated genuine intelligence.  He
also radiated a smell that would have knocked over a wall and caused sinus
trouble in a dead fox.

Granny Weatherwax milked and fed the goats, banked the fire, and put a
cloth over the mirror and pulled her broomstick out from behind the door.
She went out, locked the door behind her, and hung the key on its nail in
the privy.

This was quite sufficient.  Only once, in the entire history of witchery
in the Ramtops, had a thief broken into a witch's cottage.  The witch
concerned visited the most terrible punishment on him.(1)

Granny sat on the broom and muttered a few words, but without much
conviction.  After a further couple of tries, she got off, fiddled with
the binding, and had another go.  There was a suspicion of glitter from
one end of the stick, which quickly died away.

"Drat," she said, under her breath.

She looked around carefully, in case anyone was watching.  In fact it was
only a hunting badger who, hearing the thumping of running feet, poked its
head out from the bushes and saw Granny hurtling down the path with the
broomstick held stiff-armed beside her.  At last the magic caught, and she
managed to vault clumsily on to it before it trundled into the night sky
as gracefully as a duck with one wing missing.

From above the trees came a muffled curse against all dwarfish mechanics.

"Um.  No, my lord.  It's my hankerchief, you see.  You can sort of tell the

"/Good/ fool," said the duke, vaguely.

Totally mad, the Fool thought.  Several bricks short of a bundle.  So far
round the twist you could use him to open wine bottles.

"Kneel beside me," my Fool.

The Fool did so.  The duke laid a soiled bandage on his shoulder.

"Are you loyal, Fool?" he said.  "Are you trustworthy?"

"I swore to follow my lord until death," said the Fool hoarsely.

The duke pressed his mad face close to the Fool, who looked up into a pair

"I didn't want to," he hissed conspiratorially.  "They made me do it.  I

The door swung open.  The duchess filled the doorway.  In fact, she was
nearly the same shape.

"Leonal!" she barked.

The fool was fascinated by what happened to the duke's eyes.  The mad red
flame vanished, was sucked backwards, and replaced by the hard blue stare
he had come to recognize.  It didn't mean, he realized, that the duke was
any less mad.  Even the coldness of his sanity was madness in a way.  The

On the crest of the moor, where in the summer partridges lurked among the

The stone was about the same height as a tall man, and made of a bluish

few blind spots.  While intellectually she would concede that he was
indeed a fat, cunning, evil-smelling multiple rapist, she nevertheless
instinctively pictured him as the small fluffy kitten he had been decades
before.  The fact that he had once chased a female wolf up a tree and
seriously surprised a she-bear who had been innocently digging for roots
didn't stop her worrying that something bad might happen to him.  It was

%passage 13
On top of the general suspicion of witches, it was dawning on the few people
in Lancre who had any dealings with the outside world that a) either more
things had been happening than they had heard about before or b) time was
out of joint.  It wasn't easy to prove(1) but the few traders who came along
the mountain tracks after the winter seemed to be rather older than they
should have been.  Unexplained happenings were always more or less expected
in the Ramtops because of the high magical potential, but several years
disappearing overnight was a bit of a first.

(1) Because of the way time was recorded among the various states, kingdoms
and cities.  After all, when over an area of a hundred square miles the same
year is variously the Year of the Small Bat, the Anticipated Monkey, the
Hunting Cloud, Fat Cows, Three Bright Stallions and at least nine numbers
recording the time since(2) assorted kings, prophets, and strange events were
either crowned, born or happened, and each year was a different number of
months, and some of them don't have weeks, and one of them refuses to accept
the day as a measure of time, the only things it is possible to be sure of
is that good sex doesn't last long enough.(3)

(2) The calendar of the Theocracy of Muntab counts /down/, not up.  No-one
knows why, but it might not be a good idea to hang around and find out.

(3) Except for the Zapingo tribe of the Great Nef, of course.

It was a full-length mirror.  All assassins had a full-length mirror in
their rooms, because it would be a terrible insult to anyone to kill them
when you were badly dressed.

Teppic examined himself critically.  The outfit had cost him his last
penny, and was heavy on the black silk.  It whispered as he moved.  It was
pretty good.

At least the headache was going.  It had nearly crippled him all day; he'd
been in dread of having to start the run with purple spots in front of his
eyes.

He sighed and opened the black box and took out his rings and slipped them
on.  Another box held a set of knives of Klatchian steel, their blades
darkened with lamp black.  Various cunning and intricate devices were taken
from velvet bags and dropped into pockets.  A couple of long-bladed
throwing /tlingas/ were slipped into their sheaths inside his boots.  A
thin silk line and folding grapnel were wound around his waist, over the
chain-mail shirt.  A blowpipe was attached to its leather thong and dropped
down his back under his cloak; Teppic pocketed a slim tin container with an
assortment of darts, their tips corked and their stems braille-coded for
ease of selection in the dark.

He winced, checked the blade of his rapier and slung the baldric over his
right shoulder, to balance the bag of lead slingshot ammunition.  As an
afterthought he opened his sock drawer and took a pistol crossbow, a flask
of oil, a roll of lockpicks and, after some consideration, a punch dagger,
a bag of assorted caltraps and a set of brass knuckles.

Teppic picked up his hat and checked its lining for the coil of cheesewire.
He placed it on his head at a jaunty angle, took a last satisfied look at
himself in the mirror, turned on his heel and, very slowly, fell over.

A few stars had been let out early.  Teppic looked up at them.  Perhaps, he

that there are billions of universes stacked along side one another, the
thickness of a thought apart, then there must be people elsewhere.

But wherever they are, no matter how mightily they try, no matter how
magnificent the effort, they surely can't manage to be as godawfully stupid

It's a fact as immutable as the Third Law of Sod that there is no such

apparently part of the job spec.

High priests tend to get put in the same category.  They have to face the
implied assumption that no sooner do they get the funny hat than they're
issuing strange orders, e.g., princesses tied to rocks for itinerant sea
monsters and throwing little babies in the sea.

This is a gross slander.  Throughout the history of the Disc most high
priests have been serious, pious and conscientious men who have done their
best to interpret the wishes of the gods, sometimes disembowelling or
flaying alive hundreds of people in a day in order to make sure they're
getting it absolutely right.

Copolymer, the greatest storyteller in the history of the world, sat back
and beamed at the greatest minds in the world, assembled at the dining
table.

Teppic had added another iota to his store of new knowledge.  'Symposium'
meant a knife-and-fork tea.

"Well," said Copolymer, and launched into the story of the Tsortean Wars.

"You see, what happened was, /he'd/ taken /her/ back home, and her
father--this wasn't the old king, this was the one before, the one with the
wossname, he married some girl from over Elharib way, she had a squint,
what was her name now, began with a P.  Or an L.  One of them letters,
anyway.  Her father owned an island out on the bay there, Papylos I think
it was.  No, I tell a lie, it was Crinix.  /Anyway/ the king, the other
king, he raised an army and they....  Elenor, that was her name.  She had
a squint, you know.  But quite attractive, they say.  When I say married,
I trust I do not have to spell it out for you.  I mean, it was a bit
unofficial.  Er.  Anyway, there was this wooden horse and after they'd got
in...  Did I tell you about this horse?  It was a horse.  I'm pretty sure
it was a horse.  Or maybe it was a chicken.  Forget my own name next!  It
was wossname's idea, the one with the limp.  Yes.  The limp in his leg, I
mean.  Did I mention him?  There'd been this fight.  No, that was the other
one, I think.  Yes.  Anyway, this wooden pig, damn clever idea, they made
it out of thing.  Tip of my tongue.  Wood.  But that was later, you know.
The fight!  Nearly forgot the fight.  Yes.  Damn good fight.  Everyone
banging on their shields and yelling.  Wossname's armour shone like shining
armour.  Fight and a half, that fight.  Between thingy, not the one with
the limp, the other one, wossname, had red hair.  /You/ know.  Tall fellow,
talked with a lisp.  Hold on, just remembered, he was from some other
island.  Not him.  The other one, with the limp.  Didn't want to go, he
said he was mad.  Of course, he /was/ bloody mad, definitely.  I mean, a
wooden cow!  Like wossname said, the king, no not that king, the other one,
he saw the goat, he said 'I fear the Ephibeans, especially when they're mad
enough to leave bloody great wooden livestock on the doorstep, talk about
nerve, they must think we was born yesterday, set fire to it,' and, of
course, wossname had nipped in round the back and put everyone to the
sword, talk about laugh.  Did I say she had a squint?  They said she was
pretty, but it takes all sorts.  Yes.  Anyway, that's how it happened.
/Now/, of course, wossname--I think he was called Melycanus, had a limp--he
wanted to go home, well, you would, they'd been there for /years/, he
wasn't getting any younger.  That's why he dreamt up the thing about the
wooden wossname.  Yes.  I tell a lie, Lavaelous was the one with the knee.
Pretty good fight, that fight, take it from me."

He lapsed into self-satisfied silence.

"Pretty good fight," he mumbled and, smiling faintly, dropped off to sleep.

Teppic was aware that his own mouth was hanging open.  He shut it.  Along
the table several of the diners were wiping their eyes.

"Magic," said Xeno.  "Sheer magic.  Every word a tassle on the canopy of
Time."

"It's the way he remembers every tiny detail.  Pin sharp," murmured Ibid.

to a conversation further along the table.  A philosopher had averred that
although truth was beauty, beauty was not necessarily truth, and a fight was
breaking out.  Endos listened carefully.(1)

(1) The role of listeners has never been fully appreciated.  However, it is
well known that most people don't listen.  They use the time when someone
else is speaking to think of what they're going to say next.  True Listeners

In the middle of the firestorm the Great Pyramid appeared to lift up a few
inches, on a beam of incandescence, and turn through ninety degrees.  This
was almost certainly the special type of optical illusion which can take
place /even though no-one is actually looking at it/.

And then, with deceptive slowness and considerable dignity, it exploded.

It was almost too crass a word.  What it did was this:  it came apart
ponderously into building-sized chunks which drifted gently away from one
another, flying serenely out and over the necropolis.  Several of them
struck other pyramids, badly damaging them in a lazy, unselfconscious way,
and then bounded on in silence until they ploughed to a halt behind a small
mountain of rubble.

Only then did the boom come.  It went on for quite a long time.

Captain Vimes limped forward from the shadows.

A small and extremely frightened golden dragon was clamped firmly under one
arm.  His other hand held it by the tail.

The rioters watched it, hypnotised.

"Now I know what you're thinking," Vimes went on, softly.  "You're

Demons and their Hell are quite different from the Dungeon Dimensions,
those endless parallel wastelands outside space and time.  The sad, mad
Things in the Dungeon Dimensions have no understanding of the world but
simply crave light and shape and try to warm themselves by the fires of
reality, clustering around it with about the same effect--if they ever
broke through--as an ocean trying to warm itself around a candle.  Whereas
demons belong to the same space-time wossname, more or less, as humans,
and have a deep and abiding interest in humanity's day-to-day affairs.
Interestingly enough, the gods of the Disc have never bothered much about
judging the souls of the dead, so people can only go to hell if that's
where they believe, in their deepest heart, that they deserve to go.
Which they won't do if they don't know about it.  This explains why it is
important to shoot missionaries on sight.

He looked down.  There was a dog sitting by his feet.

It was small, bow-legged and wiry, and basically grey but with patches of
brown, white, and black in outlying areas, and it was staring.

It was certainly the most penetrating stare Victor had ever seen.  It
wasn't menacing, or fawning.  It was just very slow and very thorough, as
though the dog was memorising details so that it could give a full
description to the authorities later.

[...]

Victor let his gaze slide downwards.  There was nothing there but the little
dog, industriously scratching itself.  It looked up slowly, and said "Woof?"

[...]

Victor poked an exploratory finger in his ear.  It must have  been a trick
of an echo, or something.  It wasn't that the dog had gone "woof!", although
that was practically unique in itself; most dogs in the universe /never/
went "woof!", they had complicated barks like "whuuugh!" and "hwhoouf!".
No, it was that it hadn't in fact /barked/ at all.  It had /said/ "woof".

[...]

One of the last things Victor remembered was a voice beside his knee saying,
"Could have bin worse, mister.  I could have said 'miaow'."

Cut-me-own-Throat Dibbler was one of those rare people with the ability to
think in straight lines.

Most people think in curves and zig-zags.  For example, they start with a
thought like:  I wonder how I can become very rich, and then proceed along
an uncertain course which includes thoughts like:  I wonder what's for
supper, and:  I wonder who I know that can lend me five dollars?

Whereas Throat was one of those people who could identify the thought at the
other end of the process, in this case /I am now very rich/, draw a line
between the two, and then think his way along it, slowly and patiently,
until he got to the other end.

Not that it worked.  There was always, he found, some small but vital flaw
in the process.  It generally involved a strange reluctance on the part of
people to buy what he had to sell.

Magic wasn't difficult.  That was the big secret that the whole baroque
edifice of wizardry had been set up to conceal.  Anyone with a bit of
intelligence and enough perseverance could do magic, which was why the
wizards cloaked it with rituals and the whole pointy-hat business.

The trick was to do magic and /get away with it/.

Because it was as if the human race was a field of corn and magic helped
the users grow just that bit taller, so that they stood out.  That
attracted the attention of gods and--Victor hesitated--other Things outside

It was later that the story of Windle Poons really came to an end, if
"story" means all that he did and caused and set in motion.  In the Ramtop
villages where they dance the real Morris dance, for example, they believe
that no one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die
away--until the clock he wound up winds down, until the wine she made has
finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested.  The span

Wizards don't believe in gods in the same way that most people don't find it
necessary to believe in, say, tables.  They know they're there, they know
they're there for a purpose, they'd probably agree that they have a place in
a well-organized universe, but they wouldn't see the point of /believing/,
of going around saying, "O great table, without whom we are as naught".
Anyway, either the gods are there whether you believe or not, or exist only
as a function of the belief, so either way you might as well ignore the
whole business and, as it were, eat off your knees.

Nevertheless, there is a small chapel off the University's Great Hall,
because while the wizards stand right behind the philosophy as outlined
above, you don't become a successful wizard by getting up gods' noses even
if those noses only exist in an ethereal or metaphorical sense.  Because
while wizards don't believe in gods they know for a fact that /gods/ believe

adventurer; everyone else liked to describe him as itinerant pedlar whose
moneymaking schemes were always let down by some small but vital flaw, such
as trying to sell things he didn't own or which didn't work or, sometimes,

Over the fireplace was an ornamental candlestick, fixed to a bracket on the

It was coming unscrewed.  It spun around slowly, squeaking once a turn.
After half a dozen turns it fell off and clattered to the floor.

Inexplicable phenomena were not in themselves unusual on the Discworld.(1)
It was just that they normally had more point, or at least were a bit more
interesting.

(1) Rains of fish, for example, were so common in the little land-locked
village of Pine Dressers that it had a flourishing smoking, canning and

Desiderata Hollow was making her will.

When Desiderata Hollow was a girl, her grandmother had given her four
important pieces of advice to guide her young footsteps on the unexpectedly
twisting pathway of life.

They were:

Never trust a dog with orange eyebrows,

Always get the young man's name and address,

Never get between two mirrors,

And always wear completely clean underwear every day because you never knew
when you were going to be knocked down and killed by a runaway horse and if
people found you had unsatisfactory underwear on, you'd die of shame.

And then Desiderata grew up to become a witch.  And one of the minor
benefits of being a witch is that you know exactly when you're going to die
and can wear what underwear you like.(1)

That had been eighty years earlier, when the idea of knowing exactly when
you were going to die had seemed quite attractive because secretly, of
course, you knew you were going to live forever.

That was then.

And this was now.

Forever didn't seem to last as long these days as once it did.

Dwarfs are immensely strong for their size.  The wheel seemed to offer him

Somewhere in the mechanism something resisted for a moment and then went

There are various forms of voodoo in the multiverse, because it's a
religion that can be put together from any ingredients that happen to be
lying around.  And all of them try, in some way, to call a god into the body
of a human being.

That was stupid, Mrs. Gogol thought.  That was dangerous.

Mrs. Gogol's voodoo worked the other way about.  What was a god?  A focus of
belief.  If people believed, a god began to grow.  Feebly at first, but if
the swamp taught anything, it taught patience.  Anything could be the focus
of a god.  A handful of feathers with a red ribbon around them, a hat and
coat on a couple of sticks... anything.  Because when all people had was
practically nothing, then anything could be almost everything.  And then you
fed it, and lulled it, like a goose heading for pate, and let the power grow
very slowly, and when the time was ripe you opened the path... backwards.
A human could ride the god, rather than the other way around.  There would

Greebo leapt.

Cats are like witches.  They don't fight to kill, but to win.  There is a
difference.  There's no point in killing an opponent.  That way, they won't
know they've lost, and to be a real winner you have to have an opponent who
is beaten and knows it.  There's no triumph over a corpse, but a beaten
opponent, who will remain beaten every day for the remainder of their sad
and wretched life, is something to treasure.

Cats do not, of course, rationalise this far.  They just like to send
someone limping off minus a tail and a few square inches of fur.

Greebo's technique was unscientific and wouldn't have stood a chance against
any decent swordsmanship, but on his side was the fact that it is almost
impossible to develop decent swordsmanship when you seem to have run into a
food mixer that is biting your ear off.

The witches watched with interest.

So history has its caretakers.

They live ... well, in the nature of things they live wherever they are
sent, but their /spiritual/ home is in a hidden valley in the high Ramtops
of the Discworld, where the books of history are kept.

These aren't books in which the events of the past are pinned like so many
butterflies to a cork.  These are the books from which history is derived.
There are more than twenty thousand of them, each one is ten feet high,
bound in lead, and the letters are so small that they have to be read with
a magnifying glass.

When people say "It is written ..." it is written /here/.

There are fewer metaphors than people think.

Every month the abbot and two senior monks go into the cave where the
books are kept.  It used to be the duty of the abbot alone, but two other
reliable monks were included after the unfortunate case of the 59th Abbot,
who made a million dollars in small bets before his fellow monks caught up
with him.

Besides, it's dangerous to go in alone.  The sheer concentratedness of
History, sleeting past soundlessly out into the world, can be overwhelming.
Time is a drug.  Too much of it kills you.

It was the Year of the Notional Serpent, or two hundred years after the
Declaration of the Prophet Abbys.

Which meant that the time of the 8th Prophet was imminent.

That was the reliable thing about the Church of the Great God Om.  It had
very punctual prophets.  You could set your calendar by them, if you had
one big enough.

And, as is generally the case around the time a prophet is expected, the
Church redoubled its efforts to be holy.  This was very much like the
bustle you get in any large concern when the auditors are expected, but
tended towards taking people suspected of being less holy and putting them
to death in a hundred ingenious ways.  This is considered a reliable
barometer of the state of one's piety in most of the really popular
religions.  There's a tendency to declare that there is more backsliding
around than in the national toboggan championships, that heresy must be
torn out root and branch, and even arm and leg and eye and tongue, and
that it's time to wipe the slate clean.  Blood is generally considered
very efficient for this purpose.

All over the world there were rulers with titles like the Exalted, the

the ruler elected by the people, who could remove him whenever they
wanted--and they called him the Tyrant.

The Ephebians believed that every man should have the vote.(1)  Every five
years someone was elected to be Tyrant, provided he could prove that he
was honest, intelligent, sensible, and trustworthy.  Immediately after he
was elected, of course, it was obvious to everyone that he was a criminal
madman and totally out of touch with the view of the ordinary philosopher
in the street looking for a towel.  And then five years later they elected

It was very hard, being a reader in Invisible Writings.(1)

(1) The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by
the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space.  The thaumic
mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books,
everywhere, affect all other books.  This is obvious:  books inspire
other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past.
But the General Theory(2) of L-Space suggests that, in that case, the
contents of books /as yet unwritten/ can be deduced from books now in
existence.

What is magic?

There is the wizards' explanation, which comes in two forms, depending on

stars, bananas, chants, runes, and the importance of having at least four
good meals every day.  Younger wizards, particularly the pale ones who
spend most of their time in the High Energy Magic building,(1) chatter at
length about fluxes in the morphic nature of the universe, the essentially
impermanent quality of even the most apparently rigid time-space framework,
the impossibility of reality, and so on:  what this means is that they have
got hold of something hot and are gabbling the physics as they go along.

"The main door is in Morpork Street.  But no one comes in here for months.
Till pork exists."(1)

Cuddy shivered.

(1) Probably no other world in the multiverse has warehouses for things
which only exist /in potentia/, but the pork futures warehouse in Ankh-
Morpork is a product of the Patrician's rules about baseless metaphors,
the literal-mindedness of citizens who assume that everything must
exist somewhere, and the general thinness of the fabric of reality
around Ankh, which is so thin that it's as thin as a very thin thing.
The net result is that trading in pork futures--in pork /that doesn't
exist yet/--led to the building of the warehouse to store it until it
does.  The extremely low temperatures are caused by the imbalance in
the temporal energy flow.  At least, that's what the wizards in the
High Energy Magic building say.  And they've got proper pointy hats and

Anyone got the dried frog pills?"

It was a complete mystery to Mustrum Ridcully, a man designed by nature to
live outdoors and happily slaughter anything that coughed in the bushes,
why the Bursar (a man designed by Nature to sit in a small room somewhere,
adding up figures) was so nervous.  He'd tried all sorts of things to, as
he put it, buck him up.  These included practical jokes, surprise early
morning runs, and leaping out at him from behind doors while wearing
Willie the Vampire masks in order, he said, to take him out of himself.

%passage 7
The Library didn't only contain magical books, the ones which are chained
to their shelves and are very dangerous.  It also contained perfectly
ordinary books, printed on commonplace paper in mundane ink.  It would be
a mistake to think that they weren't also dangerous, just because reading
them didn't make fireworks go off in the sky.  Reading them sometimes did
the more dangerous trick of making fireworks go off in the privacy of the
reader's brain.

For example, the big volume open in front of him contained some of the
collected drawings of Leonard of Quirm, skilled artist and certified
genius, with a mind that wandered so much it came back with souvenirs.

Leonard's books were full of sketches--of kittens, of the way water flows,
of the wives of influential Ankh-Morporkian merchants whose portraits had
provided his means of making a living.  But Leonard had been a genius and
was deeply sensitive to the wonders of the world, so the margins were full
of detailed doodles of whatever was on this mind at the moment--vast
water-powered engines for bringing down city walls on the heads of the
enemy, new types of siege guns for pumping flaming oil over the enemy,
gunpowder rockets that showered the enemy with burning phosphorous, and
other manufactures of the Age of Reason.

And there had been something else.  The Librarian had noticed it in
passing once before, and had been slightly puzzled by it.  It seemed out
of place.(1)

Some religions say that the universe was started with a word, a song,
a dance, a piece of music.  The Listening Monks of the Ramtops have
trained their hearing until they can tell the value of a playing card by
listening to it, and have made it their task to listen intently to the
subtle sounds of the universe to piece together, from the fossil echoes,
the very first noises.

There was certainly, they say, a very strange noise at the beginning of
everything.

But the keenest ears (the ones who win most at poker), who listen to the
frozen echoes in the ammonites and amber, swear they can detect some tiny
sounds before that.

It sounded, they say, like someone counting:  One, Two, Three, Four.

The very best one, who listened to basalt, said he thought he could make
out, very faintly, some numbers that came even earlier.

When they asked him what it was, he said:  "It sounds like One, Two."

The Death of Rats put his nose in his paws.  It was a lot easier with
rats.(1)

(1) Rats had featured largely in the history of Ankh-Morpork.  Shortly
before the Patrician came to power there was a terrible plague of rats.
The city council countered it by offering twenty pence for every rat
tail.  This did, for a week or two, reduce the number of rats--and then
people were suddenly queueing up with tails, the city treasury was being
drained, and no one seemed to be doing much work.  And there /still/
seemed to be a lot of rats around.  Lord Vetinari had listened carefully
while the problem was explained, and had solved the thing with one
memorable phrase which said a lot about him, about the folly of bounty
offers, and about the natural instinct of Ankh-Morporkians in any
situation involving money:  "Tax the rat farms."

The Archchancellor polished this staff as he walked along.  It was a
particularly good one, six feet long and quite magical.  Not that he used
magic very much.  In his experience, anything that couldn't be disposed of
with a couple of whacks from six feet of oak was probably immune to magic
as well.

"Don't you think we should have brought the senior wizards, sir?" said
Ponder, struggling to keep up.

"I'm afraid that taking them along in their present state of mind would
only make what happens"--Ridcully sought for a useful phrase, and settled
for--"happen worse.  I've insisted they stay in college."

"How about Drongo and the others?" said Ponder hopefully.

"Would they be any good in the event of a thaumaturgical dimension rip of
enormous proportions?" said Ridcully.  "I remember poor Mr. Hong.  One
minute he was dishing up an order of double cod and mushy peas, the

"Kaboom?" said Ponder.

"Kaboom?" said Ridcully, forcing his way up the crowded street.  "Not

"Um.  Probably not, Archchancellor."

"Correct."

Many things went on at Unseen University and, regrettably, teaching had to
be one of them.  The faculty had long ago confronted this fact and had
perfected various devices for avoiding it.  But this was perfectly all
right because, to be fair, so had the students.

The system worked quite well and, as happens in such cases, had taken on
the status of a tradition.  Lectures clearly took place, because they
were down there on the timetable in black and white.  The fact that no one
attended was an irrelevant detail.  It was occasionally maintained that
this meant that the lectures did not in fact happen at all, but no one ever
attended them to find out if this was true.  Anyway, it was argued (by the
Reader in Woolly Thinking(1)) that lectures had taken place /in essence/,
so that was all right, too.

And therefore education at the University mostly worked by the age-old
method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinity of a lot of books
and hoping that something would pass from one to the other, while the
actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns
for exactly the same reason.

'It's my boy ...'

Granny opened the door farther and saw the woman standing behind Mr. Slot.
One look at her face was enough.  There was a bundle in her arms.

Granny stepped back.  'Bring him in and let me have a look at him.'

She took the baby from the woman, sat down on the room's one chair, and
pulled back the blanket.  Nanny Ogg peered over her shoulder.

'Hmm,' said Granny, after a while.  She glanced at Nanny, who gave an
almost imperceptible shake of her head.

'There's a curse on this house, that's what it is,' said Slot.  'My best
cow's been taken mortally sick, too.'

'Oh?  You have a cowshed?' said Granny.  'Very good place for a sickroom,

'History is about things changing.'

Granny sat back.

'Then I challenge you to a game.  That's traditional.  That's /allowed/.'

Death was silent for a moment.

THIS IS TRUE.

'Good.'

CHALLENGING ME BY MEANS OF A GAME IS ALLOWABLE.

"Yes."

HOWEVER ... YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO WIN ALL YOU MUST GAMBLE ALL?

'Double or quits?  Yes, I know.'

OR CRIPPLE MR. ONION.  I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES.

'Very well.  How about one hand of poker?  Five cards each, no draws?
Sudden death, as they say.'

Death thought about this, too.

YOU KNOW THIS FAMILY?

'No.'

THEN WHY?

'Are we talking or are we playing?'

Then Death laid the hand on the table.

She was a good repository for all those thoughts that Agnes couldn't think

seemed to be being made by all these upstarts that were flooding into the

"What was that again, young man?"

"Two complimentary tickets to Ankh-Morpork, ma'am.  No problem."

"Inside seats, mind.  No traveling on the top."

"Certainly, ma'am.  Excuse me while I just kneel in the dirt so's you can

People look down on stuff like geography and meteorology, and not only

look quite like real science.(1)  But geography is only physics slowed
down and with a few trees stuck on it, and meteorology is full of
excitingly fashionable chaos and complexity.  And summer isn't a time.
It's a place as well.  Summer is a moving creature and likes to go south

Upstairs, Vimes pushed open his office door carefully.  The Assassins'
Guild played to rules.  You could say that about the bastards.  It was
terribly bad form to kill a bystander.  Apart from anything else, you
wouldn't get paid.  So traps in his office were out of the question,
because too many people were in and out of it every day.  Even so, it
paid to be careful.  Vimes /was/ good at making the kind of rich enemies

Everyone in the city looked after themselves.  That's what the guilds were
for.  People banded together against other people.  The guild looked after
you from the cradle to the grave or, in the case of the Assassins, to
other people's graves.  They even maintained the law, or at least they had
done, after a fashion.  Thieving without a license was punishable by death
for the first offense.(1)  The Thieves' Guild saw to that.  The arrangement
sounded unreal, but it worked.

It worked like a machine.  That was fine except for the occasional people
who got caught in the wheels.

the first offence should prevent the possibility of a second offense.

Vimes struggled to his feet, shook his head, and set off after it.  No

Vimes pounded through the fog after the fleeing figure.  It wasn't quite
so fast as him, despite the twinges in his legs and one or two warning
stabs from his left knee, but whenever he came close to it some muffled
pedestrian got in the way, or a cart pulled out from a cross street.(1)

(1) This always happens in any police chase /anywhere/.  A heavily laden
lorry will /always/ pull out of a side alley in front of the pursuit.  If

Samuel Vimes dreamed about Clues.

He had a jaundiced view of Clues.  He instinctively distrusted them.  They
got in the way.

And he distrusted the kind of person who'd take one look at another man
and say in a lordly voice to his companion, "Ah, my dear sir.  I can tell
you nothing except that he is a left-handed stonemason who has spent some
years in the merchant navy and has recently fallen on hard times," and
then unroll a lot of supercilious commentary about calluses and stance
and the state of a man's boots, when /exactly the same/ comments could
apply to a man who was wearing his old clothes because he'd been doing a
spot of home bricklaying for a new barbecue pit, and had been tattooed
once when he was drunk and seventeen(1) and in fact got seasick on a wet
pavement.  What arrogance!  What an insult to the rich and chaotic variety
of the human experience.

It was the same with more static evidence.  The footprints in the
flowerbed were probably /in the real world/ left by the window-cleaner.
The scream in the night was quite likely a man getting out of bed and
stepping sharply on an upturned hairbrush.

The real world was far too /real/ to leave neat little hints.  It was full
of too many things.  It wasn't by eliminating the impossible that you got
at the truth, however improbable; it was by the much harder process of
eliminating the possibilities.  You worked away, patiently asking questions
and looking hard at things.  You walked and talked, and in your heart you
just hoped like hell that some bugger's nerve'd crack and he'd give himself
up.

hemispherical view of the world.  Since there were two separate visions,
Rogers had reasoned, that meant there must be two bulls (bulls not having

Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree.

But people have always been dimly aware of the problem with the start of
things.  They wonder how the snowplow driver gets to work, or how the
makers of dictionaries look up the spelling of words.  Yet there is the
constant desire to find some point in the twisting, knotting, raveling
nets of space-time on which a metaphorical finger can be put to indicate
that here, /here/, is the point where it all began ...

/Something/ began when the Guild of Assassins enrolled Mister Teatime,
who saw things differently from other people, and one of the ways that
he saw things differently from other people was in seeing other people
as things (later, Lord Downey of the Guild said, "We took pity on him
because he'd lost both parents at an early age.  I think that, on
reflection, we should have wondered a bit more about that.")

If asked to describe what they did for a living, the five men around the
table would have said something like "This and that" or "The best I can,"
although in Banjo's case he'd probably have said "Dur?"  They were, by the
standards of an uncaring society, criminals, although they wouldn't have
thought of themselves as such and couldn't even /spell/ words like
"nefarious."  What they generally did was move things around.  Sometimes
the things were on the wrong side of a steel door, or in the wrong house.
Sometimes the things were in fact people who were far too unimportant to
trouble the Assassins' Guild with, but who were nevertheless inconveniently
positioned where they were and would be much better located on, for
example, a sea bed somewhere.(1)  None of the five belonged to any formal
guild and they generally found their clients among those people who, for
their own dark reasons, didn't want to put the guilds to any trouble,
sometimes because they were guild members themselves.  They had plenty of
work.  There was always something that needed transferring from A to B or,
of course, to the bottom of the C.

(1) Chickenwire had got his name from his own individual contribution to
the science of this very specialized "concrete overshoe" form of waste
disposal.  An unfortunate drawback of the process was the tendency for
bits of the client to eventually detach and float to the surface, causing
much comment among the general population.  Enough chicken wire, he pointed
out, would solve that, while also allowing the ingress of crabs and fish
going about their vital recycling activities.

Although it was Hogswatch the University buildings were bustling.  Wizards
didn't go to bed early in any case,(1) and of course there was the
Hogswatchnight Feast to look forward to at midnight.

It would give some idea of the scale of the Hogswatchnight Feast that a
light snack at UU consisted of three or four courses, not counting the
cheese and nuts.

Some of the wizards had been practicing for weeks.  The Dean in particular
could now lift a twenty-pound turkey on one fork.  Having to wait until
midnight merely put a healthy edge on appetites already professionally
honed.

(1) Often they lived to a time scale to suit themselves.  Many of the
senior ones, of course, lived entirely in the past, but several were like
the Professor of Anthropics, who had invented an entire temporal system
based on the belief that all the other ones were a mere illusion.

Many people are aware of the Weak and Strong Anthropic Principles.  The
Weak One says, basically, that it was jolly amazing of the universe to be
constructed in such a way that humans could evolve to a point where they
could make a living in, for example, universities, while the Strong One
says that, on the contrary, the whole point of the universe was that
humans should not only work in universities, but also write for huge sums
books with words like "Cosmic" and "Chaos" in the titles.(2)

The UU Professor of Anthropics had developed the Special and Inevitable
Anthropic Principle, which was that the entire reason for the existence of
the universe was the eventual evolution of the UU Professor of Anthropics.
But this was only a formal statement of the theory which absolutely
everyone, with only some minor details of a "Fill in name here" nature,
secretly believes to be true.

(2) And they are correct.  The universe clearly operates for the benefit
of humanity.  This can be readily seen by the convenient way the sun comes
up in the morning, when people are ready to start the day.

"And all the maids have got the evening off until midnight?."

"A very generous custom, I've always said," said the Senior Wrangler,

"So why, every year, do we hang a damn great bunch of mistletoe up there?"

"Well, er ... it's well, it's ... it's symbolic, Archchancellor."

around in the dusty attics of his education.

"Of ... the leaves, d'y'see ... they're symbolic of ... of green, d'y'see,
whereas the berries, in fact, yes, the berries symbolize ... symbolize

He waited.  He was not, unfortunately, disappointed.

"What of?"

"I'm not sure there /has/ to be an /of/," he said.

"Ah?  So," said the Archchancellor thoughtfully, "it could be said that
the white and green symbolize a small parasitic plant?"

"Yes, indeed," said the Senior Wrangler.

"So mistletoe, in fact, symbolizes mistletoe?"

"Exactly, Archchancellor," said the Senior Wrangler, who was now just
hanging on.

"Funny thing, that," said Ridcully, in the same thoughtful tone of voice.
"That statement is either so deep it would take a lifetime to fully
comprehend every particle of its meaning, or it is a load of absolute
tosh.  Which is it, I wonder?"

"It could be both," said the Senior Wrangler desperately.

What Ponder was worried about was the fear that he was simply engaged in a
cargo cult.  He'd read about them.  Ignorant(1) and credulous(2) people,
whose island might once have been visited by some itinerant merchant
vessel that traded pearls and coconuts for such fruits of civilization as
glass beads, mirrors, axes, and sexual diseases, would later make big model
ships out of bamboo in the hope of once again attracting this magical
cargo.  Of course, they were far too ignorant and credulous to know that
just because you built the shape you didn't get the substance ...

(1) Ignorant:  the state of not knowing what a pronoun is, or how to find
the square root of 27.4, and merely knowing childish and useless things
like which of the seventy almost identical-looking species of the purple
sea snake are the deadly ones, how to treat the poisonous pith of the
Sago-sago tree to make a nourishing gruel, how to foretell the weather by
the movements of the tree-climbing Burglar Crab, how to navigate across
a thousand miles of featureless ocean by means of a piece of string and a
small clay model of your grandfather, how to get essential vitamins from
the liver of the ferocious Ice Bear, and other such trivial matters.  It's
a strange thing that when everyone becomes educated, everyone knows about
the pronoun but no one knows about the Sago-sago.

place in it that are shared only by very unsophisticated people and the
most intelligent and advanced mathematicians and physicists.

be paid to start fighting.  And, unless you are very lucky, you end up

'Very well, then, by jingo!' he snarled.  'Alone!'

'We could certainly do with one,' said Lord Vetinari.  'We need the money.
I was about to say that we cannot /afford/ mercenaries.'

'How can this be?' said Lord Downey.  'Don't we pay our taxes?'

'Ah, I thought we might come to that,' said Lord Vetinari.  He raised
his hand and, on cue again, his clerk placed a piece of paper in it.

'Let me see now ... ah yes.  Guild of Assassins ...  Gross earnings in
the last year: AM$13,207,048.  Taxes paid in the last year: forty-seven
dollars, twenty-two pence and what on examination turned out to be a
Hershebian half-/dong/, worth one eighth of a penny.'

'That's all perfectly legal!  The Guild of Accountants--'

'Ah yes.  Guild of Accountants: gross earnings AM$7,999,011.  Taxes paid:
nil.  But, ah yes, I see they applied for a rebate of AM$200,000.'

'And what we received, I may say, included a Hershebian half-/dong/,'
said Mr Frostrip of the Guild of Accountants.

'What goes around comes around,' said Vetinari calmly.

He tossed the paper aside.  'Taxation, gentlemen, is very much like dairy
farming.  The task is to extract the maximum amount of milk with the
minimum of moo.  And I am afraid to say that these days all I get is moo.'

'Are you telling us that Ankh-Morpork is /bankrupt/?' said Downey.

'Of course.  While, at the same time, full of rich people.  I trust they

'And you have /allowed/ this wholesale tax avoidance?' said Lord Selachii.

They just haven't been paid.'

'That is a disgusting state of affairs!'

'Yes, sir?'

'Would you be so good as to assemble a squad of your most experienced men,
liaise with the tax gatherers and obtain the accumulated back taxes,

'Right, sir.  And if they resist, sir?' said Vimes, smiling nastily.

Perhaps it was because he was tired, or just because he was trying to shut
out the world, but Vimes found himself slowing down into the traditional
Watchman's walk and the traditional idling thought process.

It was an almost Pavlovian response.(1)  The legs swung, the feet moved,
the mind began to work in a certain way.  It wasn't a dream state, exactly.
It was just that the ears, nose and eyeballs wired themselves straight into
the ancient "suspicious bastard" node of his brain, leaving his higher
brain center free to freewheel.

"What was it, Leonard?"

"An experimental device for turning chemical energy into rotary motion,"
said Leonard.  "The problem, you see, is getting the little pellets of
black powder into the combustion chamber at exactly the right speed and
one at a time.  If two ignite together, well, what he have is the
/external/ combustion engine."

"And, er, what would be the purpose of it?" said the Patrician.

"I believe it could replace the horse," Leonard said proudly.

They looked at the stricken thing.

"One of the advantages of horses that people often point out," said
Vetinari, after some thought, "is that they very seldom explode.  Almost
never, in my experience, apart from that unfortunate occurrence in the hot
summer a few years ago."  With fastidious fingers he pulled something out
of the mess.  It was a pair of cubes, made out of some soft white fur and
linked together by a piece of string.  There were dots on them.

"Dice?" he said.

Leonard smiled in an embarrassed fashion.  "Yes.  I can't think why I
thought they'd help it go better.  It was just, well, an idea.  You know

He was as easily distracted as a kitten.  All that business with the

be able to flap the wings hard enough.

He needn't have worried.  Leonard was his own distraction.  He had ended

She held the lamp higher.

Ramkins looked down their noses at her from their frames, through the brown
varnish of the centuries.  Portraits were another thing that had been
collected out of unregarded habit.

Most of them were men.  They were invariably in armor and always on
horseback.  And every single one of them had fought the sworn enemies of
Ankh-Morpork.

In recent times this had been quite difficult and her grandfather, for
example, had to lead an expedition all the way to Howondaland in order to
find some sworn enemies, although there was an adequate supply and a lot
of swearing by the time he left.  Earlier, of course, it had been a lot
easier.  Ramkin regiments had fought the city's enemies all over the Sto
Plains and had inflicted heroic casualties, quite often on people in the
opposing armies.(1)

(1) It is a long-cherished tradition among a certain type of military
thinker that huge casualties are the main thing.  If they are on the other

Death had taken to keeping Rincewind's lifetimer on a special shelf in his
study, in much the way that a zoologist would want to keep an eye on a
particularly intriguing specimen.

The lifetimers of most people were the classic shape that Death thought
was right and proper for the task.  They appeared to be large eggtimers,
although, since the sands they measured were the living seconds of
someone's life, all the eggs were in one basket.

Rincewind's hourglass looked like something created by a glassblower who'd
had hiccups in a time machine.  According to the amount of actual sand it
contained--and Death was pretty good at making this kind of estimate--he
should have died long ago.  But strange curves and bends and extrusions of
glass had developed over the years, and quite often the sand was flowing
backwards, or diagonally.  Clearly, Rincewind had been hit by so much
magic, had been thrust reluctantly through time and space so often that
he'd nearly bumped into himself coming the other way, that the precise end
of his life was now as hard to find as the starting point on a roll of
really sticky transparent tape.

Death was familiar with the concept of the eternal, ever-renewed hero, the
champion with a thousand faces.  He'd refrained from commenting.  He met
heroes frequently, generally surrounded by, and this was important, the
dead bodies of /very nearly/ all of their enemies and saying, "Vot the hell
shust happened?"  Whether there was some arrangement that allowed them to
come back again afterwards was not something he would be drawn on.

But he pondered whether, if this creature /did/ exist, it was somehow
balanced by the eternal coward.  The hero with a thousand retreating backs,
perhaps.  Many cultures had a legend of an undying hero who would one day
rise again, so perhaps the balance of nature called for one who wouldn't.

Whatever the ultimate truth of the matter, the fact now was that Death did
not have the slightest idea of when Rincewind was going to die.  This was
very vexing to a creature who prided himself on his punctuality.

A black and white bird appeared, and perched on his head.

"You know what to do," said the old man.

"Him?  What a wonga," said the bird.  "I've been lookin' at him.  He's not
even heroic.  He's just in the right place at the right time."

The old man indicated that this was maybe the definition of a hero.

"All right, but why not go and get the thing yerself?" said the bird.

"You've gotta have heroes," said the old man.

"And I suppose I'll have to help," said the bird.  It sniffed, which is
quite hard to do through a beak.

"Yep.  Off you go."

He punched the dwarf in the stomach.  This was no time to play by the
Marquis of Fantailler rules.(1)

(1) The Marquis of Fantailler got into many fights in his youth, most of
them as a result of being known as the Marquis of Fantailler, and wrote
a set of rules for which he termed "the noble art of fisticuffs" which
mostly consisted of a list of places where people weren't allowed to hit
him.  Many people were impressed with his work and later stood with noble
chest outthrust and fists balled in a spirit of manly aggression against
people who hadn't read the Marquis's book but /did/ know how to knock
people senseless with a chair.  The last words of a surprisingly large
number of people were "Stuff the bloody Marquis of Fantailler--"

Corporal Cheery Littlebottom pronounced her name "Cheri."  She was a she,
and therefore a rare bloom in Ankh-Morpork.

It wasn't that dwarfs weren't interested in sex.  They saw the vital need
for fresh dwarfs to leave their goods to and continue the mining work
after they had gone.  It was simply that they also saw no point in
distinguishing between the sexes anywhere but in private.  There was no
such thing as a Dwarfish female pronoun or, once the children were on
solids, any such thing as women's work.

Then Cheery Littlebottom had arrived in Ankh-Morpork, and had seen that
there were men out there who did /not/ wear chain mail or leather
underwear(1), but /did/ wear interesting colors and exciting makeup, and
these men were called "women."

And in the little bullet head the thought had arisen:  "Why not me?"

Now she was being denounced in cellars and dwarf bars across the city as
the first dwarf in Ankh-Morpork to wear a skirt.  It was hard-wearing
brown leather and as objectively erotic as a piece of wood but, as some
older dwarfs would point out, somewhere under there were his /knees/.(2)

(1) At least of the sort /she/ normally wore.

%passage 4
One day a group of senior novices, for mischief, kicked over the little
shrine that Lu-Tze kept beside his sleeping mat.

Next morning, no sweepers turned up for work.  They stayed in their huts
with the doors barred.  After making inquiries, the abbot, who at that time
was fifty years old again, summoned the three novices to his room.  There
were three brooms leaning against the wall.  He spoke as follows:

"You know that the dreadful Battle of Five Cities did not happen because
the messenger got there in time?"

They did.  You learned this early in your studies.  And they bowed
nervously, because this was the abbot, after all.

"And you know then that when the messenger's horse threw a shoe he espied
a man trudging beside the road carrying a small portable forge and pushing
an anvil on a barrow?"

They knew.

"And you know that man was Lu-tze?"

They did.

"Surely you know that Janda Trapp, Grand Master of /Oki-doki/, /Toro-fu/,
and /Chang-fu/, has only ever yielded to one man?"

They knew.

"And you know that man is Lu-Tze?"

They did.

"You know the little shrine you kicked over last night?"

They knew.

"You know it had an owner?"

There was silence.  Then the brightest of the novices looked up at the
abbot in horror, swallowed, picked up one of the three brooms, and walked
out of the room.

The other two were slower of brain and had to follow the story all the way
through to the end.

Then one of them said, "But it was only a sweeper's shrine!"

"You will take up the brooms and sweep," said the abbot, "and you will
sweep every day, and you will sweep until the day you find Lu-Tze and dare
to say 'Sweeper, it was I who knocked over and scattered your shrine and
now I will in humility accompany you to the dojo on the Tenth Djim, in
order to learn the Right Way.'  Only then, if you are still able, may you
resume your studies here.  Understood?"(1)

Older monks sometimes complained, but someone would always say:  "Remember
that Lu-Tze's Way is not our Way.  Remember he learned everything by
sweeping unheeded while students were being educated.  Remember, he has
been everywhere and done many things.  Perhaps he is a little... strange,
but remember he walked into a citadel full of armed men and traps and
nevertheless saw to it that the Pash of Muntab choked innocently on a fish
bone.  No monk is better than Lu-Tze at finding the Time and the Place."

Some, who did not know, would say:  "What is this Way that gives him so
much power?"

And they were told:  "It is the Way of Mrs. Marietta Cosmopolite, 3 Quirm
Street, Ankh-Morpork, Rooms To Rent Very Reasonable.  No, we don't
understand it, either.  Some subsendential rubbish, apparently."

(1) And the story continues:  The novice who had protested that it was only
the shrine of a sweeper ran away from the temple; the student who said
nothing remained a sweeper for the rest of his life; and the student who
has seen the inevitable shape of the story went, after much agonizing and
several months of meticulous sweeping, to Lu-Tze and knelt and asked to be
shown the Right Way.  Whereupon the sweeper took him to the dojo of the
Tenth Djim, with its terrible multibladed fighting machines and its
fearsome serrated weapons such as the /clong-clong/ and the /uppsi/.  The
story runs that the sweeper then opened a cupboard at the back of the dojo
and produced a broom and spake thusly:  "One hand /here/ and the other
/here/, understand?  People never get it right.  Use good, even strokes
and let the broom do most of the work.  Never try to sweep up a big pile,
you'll end up sweeping every bit of dust twice.  Use your dustpan wisely,
and remember:  a small brush for the corners."

"Seeking /enlightenment/?"

"No.  The wise man does not seek enlightenment, he waits for it.  So while
I was waiting, it occurred to me that seeking perplexity might be more
fun," said Lu-Tze.  "After all, enlightenment begins where perplexity ends.
And I found perplexity.  And a kind of enlightenment, too.  I had not been
there for five minutes, for example, when some men in an alley tried to
enlighten me of what little I possessed, giving me a valuable lesson in
the ridiculousness of material things."

The reason for the story was a mix of many things.  There was humanity's
desire to do forbidden deeds merely because they were forbidden.
There was its desire to find new horizons and kill the people who live
beyond them.  There were the mysterious scrolls.  There was the cucumber.
But mostly there was the knowledge that one day, it would all be over.

'Ah, well, life goes on,' people say when someone dies.  But from the
point of view of the person who has just died, it doesn't.  It's the
universe that goes on.  Just as the deceased was getting the hang of
everything it's all whisked away, by illness or accident or, in one
case, a cucumber.  Why this has to be is one of the imponderables of
life, in the face of which people either start to pray...

'Mr Stibbons was right, was he?' said Ridcully, staring at Ponder.  'How
did you work that out so /exactly/, Mr Stibbons?'

'I, er...' Ponder felt the eyes of the wizards on him.  'I--' He stopped.
'It was a lucky guess, sir.'

The wizards relaxed.  They were extremely uneasy with cleverness, but
lucky guessing was what being a wizard was all about.

'In /theory/ yes, sir.' said Ponder.  'But that would be highly... well,

They said he was amazing.  The Amazing Maurice, they said.  He'd never
meant to be amazing.  It just happened.

He'd realized something was odd that day, just after lunch, when he'd
looked into a reflection in a puddle and thought, /that's me/.  He'd never
been /aware/ of himself before.  Of course it was hard to remember /how/
he'd thought before becoming amazing.  It seemed to him that his mind had
been just a kind of soup.

And then there had been the rats, who lived under the rubbish heap in one
corner of his territory.  He'd realized there was something educated
about the rats when he'd jumped on one and it'd said, "Can we talk about
this?" and part of his amazing new brain had told him you couldn't eat
someone who could talk.  At least, not until you'd heard what it'd got
to say.

Malicia leaned against the wall with incredible nonchalance.

There was not a click.  A panel in the floor did not slide back.

"Probably the wrong place," she said.  "I'll just rest my arm innocently
on this coat hook."

A sudden door in the wall completely failed to happen.

"Of course, it'd help if there was an ornate candlestick," said Malicia.
"They're always a surefire secret-passage lever.  Every adventurer knows
that."

"There isn't a candlestick," said Maurice.

"I know.  Some people totally fail to have any /idea/ of how to design a
proper secret passage," said Malicia.  She leaned against another piece
of wall, which had no affect whatsoever.

"I don't think you'll find it that way," said Keith, who was carefully
examining a trap.

"Oh?  Won't I?" said Malicia.  "Well at least I'm being /constructive/
about things!  Where would you look, if you're such an expert?"

"Why is there a rat hole in a rat catcher's shed?" said Keith.  "It smells
of dead rats and wet dogs and poison.  I wouldn't come near this place,
if I was a rat."

Malicia glared at him.  Then her face wrapped itself in an expression of
acute concentration, as if she was trying out several ideas in her head.

"Ye-es," she said.  "That usually works, in stories.  It's often the stupid
person who comes up with the good idea by accident."

She crouched down and peered into the hole.

"There's a sort of little lever," she said.  "I'll just give it a little
push...."

There was a /clonk/ under the floor, part of it swung back, and Keith
dropped out of sight.

"Oh, yes," said Malicia.  "I thought something like that would probably
happen."

"But first I shall need to borrow a pipe," Keith went on.

"You haven't got one?" asked the mayor.

"It got broken."

Corporal Knopf nudged the mayor.  "I've got a trombone from when I was in
the army," he said.  "It won't take a moment to get it."

The rat piper burst out laughing.

"Doesn't that count?" asked the mayor, as Corporal Knopf hurried off.

"What?  A trombone for charming rats?  No, no, let him try.  Can't blame
a kid for trying.  Good with a trombone, are you?"

"I don't know," said Keith.

"What do you mean, you don't know?"

"I meant I've never played one.  I'd be a lot happier with a flute,
trumpet, piccolo, cornet, or Lancre bagpipe, but I've seen people playing
the trombone, and it doesn't look too difficult.  It's only an overgrown
trumpet, really."

"Hah!" said the piper.  "This I'd like to see--but not hear."

The Watch came running back, rubbing a battered trombone with his sleave
and therefore making it just a bit more grimy.  Keith took it, wiped the
mouthpiece, put it to his mouth, moved the slide a few times, and then
blew one long note.

"Seems to work," he said.  "I expect I can learn as I go along."  He gave
the rat piper a brief smile.  "Do you want to go first?"

"You won't charm one rat with that mess, kid," said the piper, "but I'm
glad I'm here to see you try."

Keith gave him a smile again, took a breath, and played.

There was a tune there.  The instrument squeaked and wheezed, because
Corporal Knopf had occasionally used the thing as a hammer, but there was
a tune, quite fast, almost jaunty.  You could tap your feet to it.

Someone tapped his feet to it.

Sardines emerged from a crack in a nearby wall, going "hwun/two/three/four/"
under his breath.  The crowd watched him dance ferociously across the
cobbles until he disappeared into a drain.  Then they broke into applause.

The piper looked at Keith.

"Did that one have a /hat/ on?" he asked.

"I didn't notice," said Keith.  "Your go."

Darktan looked up at him.  It had been a long night.  He didn't want to

He took a deep breath.

"Here's what I suggest," he said.  "You pretend that rats can think, and

Sardines had pulled his straw hat out of his knapsack and was holding a

It was a /good/ routine, even Maurice had to admit.  Some towns had
advertised for a rat piper the very first time he'd done it.  People could
tolerate rats in the cream, and rats in the roof, and rats in the teapot,
but they drew the line at tap dancing.  If you saw tap dancing-rats, you
were in big trouble.  Maurice had reckoned that if only the rats could
play an accordion as well, they could do two towns a day.

"Luckily I'm prepared for every eventuality," said Malicia, and reached
into her bag.  There was a sound as of lumps of metal and bottles being
moved around.

"What have you got in here?" said Maurice.  "Everything?"

"The grapnel and rope ladder take up a lot of room," said Malicia still
feeling around.  "And then there's the big medicine kit, and the small
medicine kit, and the knife, and the other knife, and the sewing kit, and
the mirror for sending signals, and... these."

She pulled out a small bundle of black cloth.  When she unrolled it,
Maurice saw the gleam of metal.

"Ah," he said.  "Lock picks, right?  I've seen burglars at work--"

"Hairpins," said Malicia, selecting one.  "Hairpins always work in the
books I've read.  You just push one into the keyhole and twiddle.  I have
a selection of prebent ones."

Once again Maurice felt a little chill at the back of his head.  They work
in /stories/, he thought.  Oh dear me.

"And how come you know so much about picking locks?" he said.

"I told you, they lock me out of my room to punish me," said Malicia,
twiddling.

Maurice /had/ seen thieves at work.  Men breaking into buildings at night
hated to see dogs, but they didn't mind cats.  Cats never attempted to
tear their throats out.  And what thieves tended to have, he knew, were

"You're a bit young to be sent on this contract, aren't you?" said Vimes.

"Not a contract, sir," said Jocasta, still paddling.

"Come now, Miss Wiggs.  The price on my head is at least--"

"The Guild council put it in abeyance, sir," said the patient swimmer.
"You're off the register.  They're not accepting contracts on you at
present."

"And quite a few of the traps drop you into something deadly," said Vimes.

"Lucky for me that I fell into this one, eh, sir?"

"Oh, that one's deadly too," said Vimes.  "/Eventually/ deadly."  He
sighed.  He really wanted to discourage this sort of thing but... they'd
put him off the register?  It wasn't that he'd /liked/ being shot at by
hooded figures in the temporary employ of his many and varied enemies,
but he'd always looked at it as some kind of vote of confidence.  It
showed that he was annoying the rich and arrogant people who ought to be
annoyed.

Besides, the Assassin's Guild was easy to outwit.  They had strict rules,
which they followed quite honorably, and this was fine by Vimes, who, in
certain practical matters, had no rules whatever.

Off the register, eh?  The only other person not on it anymore, it was
rumored, was Lord Vetinari, the Patrician.  The Assassins understood the
political game in the city better than anyone, and if they took you off
the register it was because they felt that your departure would not only
spoil the game but also smash the board.

There were rules.  When you had a Guild of Assassins, there had to be rules
that everyone knew and that were never, ever broken.(1)

An Assassin, a real Assassin, had to look like one--black clothes, hood,
boots, and all.  If they could wear any clothes, any disguise, then what
could anyone do but spend all day sitting in a small room with a loaded
crossbow pointed at the door?

And they couldn't kill a man incapable of defending himself (although a
man worth more than AM$10,000 a year was considered automatically capable
of defending himself or at least of employing people who were).

And they had to give the target a chance.

People on the side of The People always ended up disappointed, in any

be small-minded and conservative and not very clever and were even
distrustful of cleverness.  And so, the children of the revolution
were faced with the age-old problem:  it wasn't that you had the wrong

Miss Tick did not look like a witch.  Most witches don't, at least the ones
who wander from place to place.  Looking like a witch can be dangerous when
you walk among the uneducated.  [...]

Everyone in the country carried lucky charms, and Miss Tick had worked out
that if you didn't have one, people would suspect that you /were/ a witch.
You had to be a bit cunning to be a witch.

Miss Tick did have a pointy hat, but it was a stealth hat and pointed only
when she wanted it to.

The one thing in her bag that might have made anyone suspicious was a very
small, grubby booklet entitled /An Introduction to Escapology, by the
Great Williamson/.  If one of the risks of your job is being thrown into a
pond with your hands tied together, then the ability to swim thirty yards
underwater, fully clothed, plus the ability to lurk under the weeds
breathing air through a hollow reed, count as nothing if you aren't also
/amazingly/ good at knots.

would be even better if you were Miss /Teak/, a dense foreign wood, because

There was a lot of mist around, but a few stars were visible overhead and
there was a gibbous moon in the sky.  Tiffany knew it was gibbous because
she'd read in the Almanack that /gibbous/ means what the moon looked like
when it was just a bit fatter than half full, and so she made a point of
paying attention to it around those times just so that she could say to
herself, "Ah, I see the moon's very gibbous tonight."

--and squawked as darkness dropped from the sky, gripping it in talons of
steel.  Buzzard and pigeon tumbled for a moment, and then the buzzard
gained a little height and flapped onwards.

The pigeon thought: 000000000.  But had it been more capable of coherent
thought, and knew something about how birds of prey caught pigeons,(1) it
might have wondered why it was being gripped so... kindly.  It was being

how to do it.  They taught you how to know what you were doing.

Witches were a bit like cats.  They didn't much like one another's company,

"That bastard has just walked into the place!" she hissed.  "Reacher Gilt!
I'll just kill him and join you for the pudding..."

"You can't do that!" hissed Moist.

"Oh?  Why not?"

"You're using the wrong knife!  That's for the fish!  You'll get into

She glared at him, but her hand relaxed, and something like a smile

"They don't have a knife for stabbing rich, murdering bastards?" she said.

"They bring it to the table when you order one," said Moist urgently.
"Look, this isn't the Drum, they don't just throw the body into the river!

The vision of Mr. Groat's chest kept bumping insistently against his

It is not often that a wailing woman rushes into a room and throws herself
at a man.  It had never happened to Moist before.  Now it happened, and it
seemed such a waste that the woman was Miss Maccalariat.

She tottered forward and clung to the startled Moist, tears streaming down
her face.

"Oh, Mr. Lipwig!" she wailed.  "Oh, Mr. Lipwig!"

Moist reeled under her weight.  She was dragging at his collar so hard
that he was likely to end up on the floor, and the thought of being found

He wanted to sleep.  He'd never felt this tired before.  Vimes slumped to
his knees, and then fell sideways on to the sand.

When he forced his eyes open, he saw pale stars above him, and had, once
again, the sensation that there was someone else present.

He turned his head, wincing at the stab of pain, and saw a small but
brightly lit folding chair on the sand.  A robed figure was reclining in
it, reading a book.  A scythe was stuck in the sand beside it.

A white, skeletal hand turned a page.

'You'll be Death, then?' said Vimes, after a while.

AH, MISTER VIMES, ASTUTE AS EVER.  GOT IT IN ONE, said Death, shutting the
book on his finger to keep the place.

'I've seen you before.'

I HAVE WALKED WITH YOU MANY TIMES, MISTER VIMES.

'And this is /it/, is it?'

HAS IT NEVER STRUCK YOU THAT THE CONCEPT OF A WRITTEN NARRATIVE IS SOMEWHAT
STRANGE? said Death.

Vimes could tell when people were trying to avoid something they really
didn't want to say, and it was happening here.

'Is it?' he insisted.  'Is this it?  This time I die?'

COULD BE.

'Could be?  What sort of answer is that?' said Vimes.

A VERY ACCURATE ONE.  YOU SEE, YOU ARE HAVING A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE,
WHICH INESCAPABLY MEANS THAT I MUST UNDERGO A NEAR-/VIMES/ EXPERIENCE.
DON'T MIND ME.  CARRY ON WITH WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING.  I HAVE A BOOK.

Vimes rolled over on to his stomach, gritted his teeth, and pushed himself
on to his hands and knees again.  He managed a few yards before slumping
back down.

He heard the sound of a chair being moved.

'Shouldn't you be somewhere else?' he said.

I AM, said Death, sitting down again.

'But you're here!'

AS WELL.  Death turned a page and, for a person without breath, managed a
pretty good sigh.  IT APPEARS THAT THE BUTLER DID IT.

'Did what?'

IT IS A MADE-UP STORY.  VERY STRANGE.  ALL ONE NEEDS TO DO IS TURN TO THE
LAST PAGE AND THE ANSWER IS THERE.  WHAT, THEREFORE, IS THE POINT OF
DELIBERATELY NOT KNOWING?

It sounded like gibberish to Vimes, so he ignored it.  Some of the aches

(1) That was a phrase of Sybil's that got to him.  She'd announce at lunch,
"we must have the pork tonight, it needs eating up."  Vimes never had an
actual problem with this, because he'd been raised to eat what was put in

All witches are a bit odd.  Tiffany had got used to odd, so that odd seemed
quite normal.  There was Miss Level, for example, who had two bodies,
although one of them was imaginary.  Mistress Pullunder, who bred pedigreed
earthworms and gave them all names... well, she was hardly odd at all, just
a bit peculiar, and anyway earthworms were quite interesting in a basically
uninteresting kind of way.  And there had been Old Mother Dismass, who
suffered from bouts of temporal confusion, which can be quite strange when
it happens to a witch; her mouth never moved in time with her words, and
sometimes her footsteps came down the stairs ten minutes before she did.

But when it came to odd, Miss Treason didn't just take the cake, but a
packet of biscuits too, with sprinkles on the top, and also a candle.

knives with fifteen blades and three screwdrivers and a tiny magnifying
glass and a thing for extracting earwax from chickens.

You couldn't even say precisely what they did, although Miss Tick thought
that they were a way of finding out what things the hidden bits of your
own mind already knew.  You had to make a shamble from scratch every time,

Swords and cutting off heads.  That was how you got land in the old days,
and then the rules were changed so that you didn't need a sword to own
land anymore, you just needed the right piece of paper.  But his ancestors
had still hung on to their swords, just in case people thought that the
whole thing with the bits of paper had been unfair, it being a fact that
you can't please everybody.

He'd always wanted to be good with a sword, and it had come as a shock to
find that they were so /heavy/.  He was great at air sword.  In front of a

when Mrs. Dearheart finally lost patience with her daughter's busy schedule
and arranged the wedding herself.

But he was a nearly married man, however you looked at it.  And nearly
married men didn't get mixed up with the Lavish family.  A nearly married
man was steadfast and dependable and always ready to hand his nearly wife
an ashtray.  He had to be there for his oneday children, and make sure
they slept in a well-ventilated nursery.

Moist lit the lamp and walked over to the battered wreckage of his wardrobe.
Once again he selected the tatty gray suit.  It had sentimental value; he
had been hanged in it.  And it was an unmemorable suit for an unmemorable
man, with the additional advantage, unlike black, of not showing up in the
dark.(1)  [...]

(1) Every assassin knew that real black often stood out in the dark,
because the night in the city is usually never full black, and that gray
or green merge much better.  But they wore black anyway, because style

Be one of the crowd?  It went against everything a wizard stood for,

%passage 2
Technically, the city of Ankh-Morpork is a Tyranny, which is not always
the same thing as a monarchy, and in fact even the post of Tyrant has been
somewhat redefined by the incumbent, Lord Vetinari, as the only form of
democracy that works.  Everyone is entitled to vote, unless disqualified
by reason of age or not being Lord Vetinari.

And yet it does work.  This has annoyed a number of people who feel,
somehow, that it should not work, and who want a monarch instead, thus
replacing a man who has achieved his position by cunning, a deep
understanding of the realities of the human psyche, breathtaking
diplomancy, a certain prowess with the stiletto dagger, and, all agree,
a mind like a finely balanced circular saw, with a man who has got there
by being born.(1)

However, the crown has hung on anyway, as crowns do--on the Post Office
and the Royal Bank and the Mint and, not least, in the sprawling,
brawling, squalling consciousness of the city itself.  Lots of things
live in that darkness.  There are all kinds of darkness, and all kinds
of things can be found in them, imprisoned, banished, lost or hidden.
Sometimes they escape.  Sometimes they simply fall out.  Sometimes they
just can't take it any more.

(1) A third proposition, that the city be governed by a choice of
respectable members of the community who would promise not to give
themselves airs or betray the public trust at every turn, was instantly
the subject of music hall jokes all over the city.

A wizard could do what he liked in his own study, and in the old days that
had largely meant smoking anything he fancied and farting hugely without
apologizing.  These days it meant building out into a congruent set of
dimensions.  Even the Archchancellor was doing it, which made it hard for
Ponder to protest:  he had half a mile of trout stream in his bathroom,
and claimed that messin' about in his study was what kept a wizard out
of mischief.  And, as everyone knew, it did.  It generally got him into
trouble instead.

"Remuneration?  Since when did a wizard work for wages?  We are pure
academics, Mister Stibbons!  We do not care for mere money!"

Unfortunately, Ponder was a clear logical thinker who, in times of mental
confusion, fell back on reason and honesty, which, when dealing with an
angry Archchancellor, were, to use the proper academic term, unhelpful.
And he neglected to think strategically, always a mistake when talking to
fellow academics, and as a result made the mistake of employing, as at
this point, common sense.

"That's because we never actually pay for anything very much," he said,
"and if anyone needs any petty cash they just help themselves from the
big jar--"

"We are part of the very fabric of the university, Mister Stibbons!  We
take only what we require!  We do not seek wealth!  And most certainly
we do not accept a 'post of vital importance which includes an attractive
package of remuneration,' whatever the hells that means, 'and other
benefits including a generous pension!'  A pension, mark you!  When has a

workshops became his for the use of.  And there was so much for a lad with
keen night vision to find.  He had already seen some luminous spoon ants
carrying a fork, and, to his surprise, the forgotten mazes were home to
that very rare indoorovore, the Uncommon Sock Eater.  There were some

Truth is female, since truth is beauty rather than handsomeness; this,
Ridcully reflected as the Council grumbled in, would certainly explain
the saying that a lie could run around the world before Truth got its,
correction, /her/ boots on, and since she would have to choose which
pair--the idea that any woman in the position to choose would have just
one pair of boots being beyond rational belief.  Indeed, as a goddess she
would have lots of shoes, and thus many choices:  comfy shoes for home
truths, hobnail boots for unpleasant truths, simple clogs for universal
truths and possibly some kind of slipper for self-evident truth.  More
important right now was what kind of truth he was going to have to impart
to his colleagues, and he decided not on the whole truth, but instead on
nothing but the truth, which dispensed with the need for honesty.

"You will arrange yourself into two teams, set up goals, and strive to win!
No man will leave the field of play unless injured!  The hands are not to
be used, is that clear?  Any questions?"  A hand went up.  Ridcully sought
the attached face.

"Ah, Rincewind," he said, and, because he was not a determinedly unpleasant
man, amended this to, "Professor Rincewind, of course."

"I would like permission to fetch a note from my mother, sir."

Ridcully sighed.  "Rincewind, you once informed me, to my everlasting
puzzlement, that you never knew your mother because she ran away before
you were born.  Distinctly remember writing it down in my diary.  Would
you like another try?"

"Permission to go and find my mother?"

Ridcully hesitated.  The Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography had no
students and no real duties other than to stay out of trouble.  Although
Ridcully would never admit it, it was against all reason an emeritus
position.  Rincewind was a coward and an unwitting clown, but he had
several times saved the world in slightly puzzling circumstances.  He was
a luck sink, the Archchancellor decided, doomed to being a lightning rod
for the fates so that everyone else didn't have to.  Such a person was
worth all his meals and laundry (including an above-average level of
soiled pants) and a bucket of coal every day even if he was, in Ridcully's
opinion, a bit of a whiner.  However, he was fast, and therefore useful.

"Look," said Rincewind, "a mysterious urn turns up and suddenly it's all
about football.  That bodes.  It means that something bad is going to
happen."

"Come now, it could be something wonderful," Ridcully protested.

Rincewind appeared to give this due consideration.  "Could be wonderful,
will be dreadful.  Sorry, that's how it goes."

"This is Unseen University, Rincewind.  What is there to fear?" Ridcully
said.  "Apart from me, of course.  Good heavens, this is a sport."  He
raised his voice.  "Arrange yourselves into two teams and play football!"

"Excuse me, Archchancellor," said Ponder Stibbons.  "I understand the

"Well, they could give it one hundred and ten percent if they tried
harder," said Ridcully.

"Well, yes and no, sir.  But, in fact, that would mean that you had just
made the one hundred percent bigger while it would still be one hundred

The singing of the National Anthem was always a ragged affair, the good
people of Ankh-Morpork feeling that it was unpatriotic to sing songs about
how patriotic you were, taking the view that someone singing a song about
how patriotic they were was either up to something or a Head of State.(1)

An additional problem today lay in the acoustics of the arena, which were
rather too good, coupled with the fact that the speed of sound at one end
of the stadium was slightly offbeat compared with the other end, a
drawback exacerbated when both sides tried to recover the gap.

These acoustical anomalies did not count for much if you were standing
next to Mustrum Ridcully, as the Archchancellor was one of those gentleman
who will sing it beautifully, correctly enunciated and very, very loudly.

"'When dragons belch and hippos flee, my thoughts, Ankh-Morpork, are of
thee.'" he began.

There is a lot of folklore about equestrian statues, especially the ones

placement of the horse's hooves:  If one of the horse's hooves is in the
air, the rider was wounded in battle; two legs in the air means that the
rider was killed in battle; three legs in the air indicates that the
rider got lost on the way to the battle; and four legs in the air means
that the sculptor was very, very clever.  Five legs in the air means that
there's probably at least one other horse standing behind the one you're
looking at; and the rider lying on the ground with his horse lying on top
of him with all four legs in the air means that the rider was either a

philosophy in the way a gentleman should, by digging into any suspicious-
looking burial mounds he could find in the neighborhood, filling up his
lizard press with as many rare species as he could collect, and drying
samples of any flowers he could find before they became extinct.  The
story runs that, on one warm summer day, he dozed off under an apple tree
and was awakened when an apple fell on his head.  A lesser man, as his
biographer put it, would have seen nothing untoward about this, but
Woolsthorpe surmised that, since apples and practically everything else
always fell down, then the world would eventually become dangerously
unbalanced... unless there was another agency involved that natural
philosophy had yet to discover.  He lost no time in dragging one of the
footmen to the orchard and ordering him, on the pain of dismissal, to lie
under the tree until an apple hit him on the head!  The possibility of
this happening was increased by another footman who had been told by
Woolsthorpe to shake the tree vigorously until the required apple fell.
Woolsthorpe was ready to observe this from a distance.

"Who can imagine his joy when the inevitable apple fell and a second apple
was seen rising from the tree and disappearing at speed into the vaults of
heaven, proving the hypothesis that what goes up must come down, provided
that what goes down must come up, thus safeguarding the equilibrium of the
Universe.  Regrettably, this only works with apples and, amazingly, only
the apples on this one tree, /Malus equilibria/!  I hear that someone has
worked out that the apples at the top of the tree fill with gas and fly up
when the tree is disturbed so that it can set its seeds some way off.
Wonderful thing, nature, shame the fruit tastes like dog's business,"
Willikins added as Young Sam spat some out.  [...]

"Look, Willikins, I don't like to involve you in all this.  It's only a
hunch, after all."

Willikins waved this away.  "You wouldn't keep me out of it for a big
clock, sir, because all this is tickling my fancy as well.  I shall lay
out a selection of cutting edges for you in your dressing room, sir, and I
myself will go up to the copse half an hour before you're due to be there,
with my trusty bow and an assortment of favorite playthings.  It's nearly
full moon, clear skies, there'll be shadows everywhere, and I'll be
standing in the darkest one of them."

Vimes looked at him for a moment and said, "Could I please amend that
suggestion?  Could you not be there in the second darkest shadow one hour
before midnight, to see who steps into the darkest shadow?"

"Ah yes, that's why you command the watch, sir," said Willikins, and to
Vimes's shock there was a hint of a tear in the man's voice.  "You're
listening to the street, aren't you, sir, yes?"

Vimes shrugged.  "No streets here, Willikins."

Willikins shook his head.  "Once a street boy, always a street boy, sir.
It comes with us, in the pinch.  Mothers go, fathers go--if we ever knew
who they were--but the Street, well, the Street looks after us.  In the
pinch it keeps us alive."

In the country, there is always somebody watching you, he thought as they

"Well, sir, it looks as though they're pleased to see us, yes?"

Feeney's relief and hope should have been bottled and sold to despairing
people everywhere.  Vimes just nodded, because the ranks were pulling
apart, leaving a pathway of sorts, at the end of which there was,
inarguably, a corpse.  It was a mild relief to see that it was a goblin
corpse, but no corpse is good news, particularly when seen in a grimy low
light and especially for the corpse.  And yet something inside him exulted
and cried /Hallelujah!/, because here was a corpse and he was a copper
and this was a crime and this place was smoky and dirty and full of
suspicious-looking goblins and here was a /crime/.  His world.  Yes, here

Vimes lay back in the bed, enjoying the wonderful sensation of gradually
being eaten by the pillows, and said to Sybil, "Do the Rust family have a
place down here?"

Too late he reflected that this might be a bad move because she might well
have told him all about it on one of those occasions when, so unusually for
a married man, he was not paying much attention to what his wife was
saying, and therefore he might be the cause of grumpiness in those
precious, warm minutes before sleep.  All he could see of her right now
was the very tip of her nose, as the pillows claimed her, but she mumbled,
drowsily, "Oh, they bought Hangnail Manor ten years or so ago, after the
Marquis of Fantailer murdered his wife with a pruning knife in the
pineapple house.  Don't you remember?  You spent weeks searching the city
for him.  In the end everybody seemed to think he'd gone off to Fourecks
and disguised himself by not calling himself the Marquis of Fantailer."

"Oh yes," said Vimes, "and I remember that a lot of his chums were quite
indignant about the investigation!  They said he'd only done one murder,
and it was his wife's fault for having the bad taste to die after just one
little stab!"

Vimes frowned.  He couldn't remember ever going into a church or a temple
or one of the numerous other places of more or less spirituality for any
other reason than the occasional requirements of the job.  These days he
tended to go in for reasons of Sybil, i.e., his wife dragging him along
so that he could be seen, and, if possible, seen remaining awake.

No, the world of next worlds, afterlives, and purgatorial destinations
simply did not fit into his head.  Whether you wanted it or not, you were
born, you did the best you could, and then, whether you really wanted to
or not, you died.  They were the only certainties, and so the best thing

Rhys Rhysson, Low King of the dwarfs, was a dwarf of keen intelligence,
but he sometimes wondered why someone with that intelligence would go into
dwarfish politics, let alone be King of the Dwarfs.  Lord Vetinari had it
so easy he must hardly know he was born!  The King thought that humans
were, well, reasonably sensible, whereas there was an old dwarf proverb
which, translated, said, "Any three dwarfs having a sensible conversation
will always end up having four points of view."

Curious, the Patrician thought, as Drumknott hurried away to dispatch a

mob liked better than novelty.  Lord Vetinari sighed again.  Did they
actually think?  These days /everybody/ used the clacks, even little old
ladies who used it to send him clacks messages complaining about all
these newfangled ideas, totally missing the irony.  And in this doleful
mood he ventured to wonder if they ever thought back to when things were
just old-fangled or not fangled at all as against the modern day when
fangled had reached its apogee.  Fangling was indeed, he thought, here

There clearly has been magic at work in the Netherglades and its future as
the pharmacopoeia of the world is being tested by Professor Rincewind of
Unseen University.  A dispatch from him reveals that the juice pressed from
a certain little yellow flower induces certainty in the patient for up to
fifteen minutes.  About what they are certain they cannot specify, but the
patient is, in that short time, completely certain about /everything/.  And
further research has found that a floating water hyacinth yields in its
juices total /un/certainty about anything for half a hour.  Philosophers
are excited about the uses for these potions, and the search continues for
a plant that combines the qualities of both, thereby being of great use to
theologians.

There was a young goblin waiting there, rather nervous, clasping what

Moist Von Lipwig had done some heavy work once and couldn't see any future
in it, but he could look at it for hours, provided other people were doing
it, of course, and clearly some of them liked what they were doing, and so
he shrugged and felt happy that Crisp was happy being a handyman whilst
Moist was happy not picking up anything that was heavier than a glass.
After all, his work was unseen and depended on words, which were
fortunately not very heavy and didn't need grease.  In his career as a
crook they had served him well and now he felt somewhat smug at using them
to the benefit of the citizenry.

There was a difference between a banker and a crook, there really was, and
although it was very, very teeny Moist felt that he should point out that
it did exist and, besides, Lord Vetinari always had his eye on him.

So everybody was happy and Moist went to work in very clean clothes and

She sighed.  It was such a shame when old customs disappeared.  A good
witch-ducking was something she had liked doing in the bad old days--she
had even /trained/ for it.  All those swimming lessons, and practice with
knots at the Quirm College for Young Ladies.  She had been able to defeat
the mobs under water if necessary.  Or at least work at breaking her own
record for untying the simple knots they all thought worked on the nasty
witch.

Now, a bit of pond-dipping had become more like a hobby, and she had a
nasty feeling that others were copying her after she passed through their
villages.  She'd even heard talk of a swimming club being started in one
small hamlet over by Ham-on-Rye.(1)

Roland de Chumsfanleigh,(1) the young Baron on the Chalk /did/ want to be
like his father in many ways.  He knew the old man had been popular--what
was known as an "old-school Baron," which meant that everyone knew what
to expect and the guards polished up their armor and saluted, and did
what was expected of /them/, while the Baron did what was expected of him,
and pretty much left them alone.

But his father had also been a bit of a bad-tempered bully at times.  And
/that/ bit Roland wanted to forget about.  He particularly wanted to sound
the right note when he called round to see Tiffany Aching at Home Farm.
For they had once been good friends, and to Roland's alarm, Tiffany was
thought of as a good friend by his wife Letitia.  Any man with sense was
wise to be fearful of a wife's best friends.  For who knew what ... little
secrets might be shared.  Roland, having been educated at home and with
limited knowledge of the world outside the Chalk, feared that "little"
might be /exactly/ the kind of comment Letitia might share with Tiffany.

(1) Pronounced "Chuffley" under the strange rule that the more gentrified
a family is, the more peculiar the pronunciation of their name becomes.
Tiffany had once heard a high-born visitor named Ponsonby-Macklewright

--   and lit walls show up when light reaches the spot next to them.  The unlit
--   corner is beyond candle range and isn't flagged as lit so it doesn't show

-- In case you haven't played the game Sokoban, you'll learn
-- quickly.  This branch isn't particularly difficult, just time
-- consuming.  Some players may wish to skip this branch.
--
-- The following actions are currently permitted without penalty:
--   Carrying or throwing a boulder already in inventory
--     (player or nonplayer).
--   Teleporting boulders.
--   Digging in the floor.
-- The following actions are permitted, but with a luck penalty:
--   Breaking boulders.
--   Stone-to-fleshing boulders.
--   Creating new boulders (e.g., with a scroll of earth).
--   Jumping.
--   Being pulled by a thrown iron ball.
--   Hurtling through the air from Newton's 3rd law.
--   Squeezing past boulders when naked or as a giant.
-- These actions are not permitted:
--   Moving diagonally between two boulders and/or walls.
--   Pushing a boulder diagonally.
--   Picking up boulders (player or nonplayer).
--   Digging or walking through walls.
--   Teleporting within levels or between levels of this branch.
--   Using cursed potions of gain level.
--   Escaping a pit/hole (e.g., by flying, levitation, or
--     passing a dexterity check).
--   Bones files are not permitted.

-- themerooms is an array of tables.

-- * "name" is not shown in-game; it is so that developers can specify a
--   certain room to generate by using the THEMERM or THEMERMFILL environment
--   variable. While technically optional, it should be provided on all the
--   rooms; if it isn't, the room can't be directly specified.
-- * "frequency" is optional; if omitted, 1 is assumed.
-- * "contents" is a function describing what gets put into the room.
-- * "mindiff" and "maxdiff" are optional and independent; if omitted, the
--    room is not constrained by level difficulty.
-- * "eligible" is optional; if omitted, True is assumed.
--
-- themeroom_fills is an array of tables with the exact same structure as
-- themerooms. It is used for contents of a room that are independent of its
-- shape, so that interestingly-shaped themerooms can be filled with a variety
-- of contents.
-- * The "contents" functions in themeroom_fills take the room they are
--   filling as an argument.
-- * Frequency of themeroom_fills is a separate pool from themerooms, and has
--   no effect on how likely that any given room will receive a themeroom_fill.
--
-- des.room({ type = "ordinary", filled = 1 })
--   - ordinary rooms can be converted to shops or any other special rooms.
--   - filled = 1 means the room gets random room contents, even if it
--     doesn't get converted into a special room. Without filled,
--     the room only gets what you define in here.
--   - use type = "themed" to force a room that's never converted
--     to a special room, such as a shop or a temple.
--
-- for each level, the core first calls pre_themerooms_generate(),
-- then it calls themerooms_generate() multiple times until it decides
-- enough rooms have been generated, and then it calls
-- post_themerooms_generate(). When the level has been generated, with
-- joining corridors and rooms filled, the core calls post_level_generate().
-- The lua state is persistent through the gameplay, but not across saves,
-- so remember to reset any variables.

	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.
		[ The Runaway Abbot, by G.K. Chesterton ]
	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another
	boy and me.  He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his
	mother had made him from her hair.  I, on the other hand, had
	a brand new suit of chain mail.  Just before our joust, I asked
	him what he'd do if he made the team.  (I was hoping to be more
	popular with the ladies.)  He said he would be able to save the
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me.  I insisted we swap
	armor.  He was forced to accept, as it would have been an
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor
	class was that day."

	A short studded or spiked club attached to a cord allowing

	Translucent, cryptocrystalline variety of quartz and a subvariety
	of chalcedony.  Agates are identical in chemical structure to
	jasper, flint, chert, petrified wood, and tiger's-eye, and are
	often found in association with opal.  The colorful, banded rocks
	are used as a semiprecious gemstone and in the manufacture of
	grinding equipment.  An agate's banding forms as silica from

	That I never can hope to pay;
	And if ever I should forget
	That I owe this debt to you

	Than ever I have been yet!

	"The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make
	people unhappy -- jealousy, bad temper, pride, disagreeableness,
	greediness, selfishness, laziness.  Evil spirits, people called
	them when the Amulet was made.  Don't you think it would be nice
	to have it?"
	"Very," said the children, quite without enthusiasm.
	"And it can give you strength and courage."
	"That's better," said Cyril.
	"And virtue."
	"I suppose it's nice to have that," said Jane, but not with much
	interest.
	"And it can give you your heart's desire."
	"Now you're talking," said Robert.
		[ The Story of the Amulet, by Edith Nesbit ]
	This mysterious talisman is the object of your quest.  It is
	said to possess powers which mere mortals can scarcely
	comprehend, let alone utilize.  The gods will grant the gift of
	immortality to the adventurer who can deliver it from the
	depths of Moloch's Sanctum and offer it on the appropriate high
	altar on the Astral Plane.
	He answered and said unto them, he that soweth the good seed
	is the Son of man; the field is the world, and the good seed
	are the children of the kingdom; but the weeds are the
	children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the
	devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers
	are the angels.  As therefore the weeds are gathered and
	burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
	[...]  So shall it be at the end of the world; the angels
	shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be
	wailing and gnashing of teeth.

	Cold wind blows.
	The gods look down in anger on this poor child.

	Why so unforgiving?

	An Egyptian god of war and a great hunter, few gods can match
	his fury.  Unlike many gods of war, he is a force for good.
	The wrath of Anhur is slow to come, but it is inescapable
	once earned.  Anhur is a mighty figure with four arms.  He
	is often seen with a powerful lance that requires both of
	his right arms to wield and which is tipped with a fragment
	of the sun.  He is married to Mehut, a lion-headed goddess.
	The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities
	bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home
	of a large number of gangs, thieves' guilds, syndicates and
	similar organisations.  This was one of the reasons for its
	wealth.  Most of the humbler folk on the widdershin side of
	the river, in Morpork's mazy alleys, supplemented their
	meagre incomes by filling some small role for one or other
	of the competing gangs.
	    [ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]
	A primordial Babylonian-Akkadian deity, Anshar is mentioned

	This giant variety of the ordinary ant will fight just as

	Anu was the Babylonian god of the heavens, the monarch of

	Aldo the gorilla had a plan.  It was a good plan.  It was
	right.  He knew it.  He smacked his lips in anticipation as
	he thought of it.  Yes.  Apes should be strong.  Apes should

	Archeology is the search for fact, not truth. [...]
	So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel,

		[ Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ]

	"I cannot be having with archeological excavations, myself,"
	I said.  "The fellows who dig them only ever find tiny walls
	and a few bits of broken pottery, and then they get all
	excited and swear that they have just made the most
	important discovery of the century, the ruins of a mile-high
	gold-covered temple to Frogmore the God of Bike-Saddle
	Fixtures or some such."
	"I think you will find," said Mr Rune, "that they do this

	"That is a rather cynical view," I said.

	I shot an arrow into the air,

	For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
	Could not follow it in its flight.

	I breathed a song into the air,

	Ashikaga Takauji was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who
	joined forces with the Go-Daigo to defeat the Hojo armies.
	Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
	Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another
	government in the town of Yoshino.  This period of dual
	governments was known as the Nambokucho.
	  [ Samurai - The Story of a Warrior Tradition, by Cook ]
	It is said that Asmodeus is the overlord over all of hell.
	His appearance, unlike many other demons and devils, is
	human apart from his horns and tail.  He can freeze flesh
	with a touch.
		[]

	The evil demon who appears in the Apocryphal book of _Tobit_
	and is derived from the Persian _Aeshma_.  In _Tobit_ Asmodeus
	falls in love with Sara, daughter of Raguel, and causes the
	death of seven husbands in succession, each on his bridal night.
	He was finally driven from Egypt through a charm made by Tobias
	of the heart and liver of a fish burned on perfumed ashes, as
	described by Milton in _Paradise Lost_ (IV, 167-71).  Hence
	Asmodeus often figures as the spirit of matrimonial jealousy
	or unhappiness.

	You know I cannot speak what is untrue.  During our last
	encounter I returned to Faerie with great power and upset vital
	balances.  Those balances had to be redressed, and your debt was
	the mechanism that the Queen chose to employ."
	I frowned at her for a minute.  "Returned with great power."  My
	eyes fell to the knife at her waist.  "That thing the vampires
	gave you?"
	She rested her fingers lightly on the knife's hilt.  "Don't
	cheapen it.  This athame was no creation of theirs.  And it was
	less a gift than a trade."
	"Amoracchius and that thing are in the same league?"  Gulp.  My

	"Now, this third handkerchief," Mein Herr proceeded, "has also

	"I see!" Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted.  "Its outer surface

	resumed her cup of tea.  "But why do you call it Fortunatus's
	Purse, Mein Herr?"
	The dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking
	more exactly like the Professor than ever.  "Don't you see,

	The "lord of the flies" is a translation of the Hebrew
	Ba'alzevuv (Beelzebub in Greek).  It has been suggested that
	it was a mistranslation of a mistransliterated word which

	devil whose name suggests that he is devoted to decay,
	destruction, demoralization, hysteria and panic...

	...  It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as
	if a cloud had bent over it.  Then with a rush it leaped
	the fissure.  The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed

	mane kindled, and blazed behind it.  In its right hand
	was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it
	held a whip of many thongs.

	Extinct rhinos include a variety of forms, the most
	spectacular being _Baluchitherium_ from the Oligocene of
	Asia, which is the largest known land mammal.  Its body, 18
	feet high at the shoulder and carried on massive limbs,
	allowed the 4-foot-long head to browse on the higher branches
	of trees.  Though not as enormous, the titanotheres of the
	early Tertiary were also large perissodactyls, _Brontotherium_
	of the Oligocene being 8 feet high at the shoulder.

	He took another step and she cocked her right wrist in
	viciously.  She heard the spring click.  Weight slapped into
	her hand.
	"Here!" she shrieked hysterically, and brought her arm up in
	a hard sweep, meaning to gut him, leaving him to blunder
	around the room with his intestines hanging out in steaming
	loops.  Instead he roared laughter, hands on his hips,
	flaming face cocked back, squeezing and contorting with great
	good humor.
	"Oh, my dear!" he cried, and went off into another gale of

	She looked stupidly down at her hand.  It held a firm yellow

	In Irish folklore and that of the Western Highlands of Scotland,

	They dressed alike -- in buckskin boots, leathern breeks and
	deerskin shirts, with broad girdles that held axes and short
	swords; and they were all gaunt and scarred and hard-eyed;
	sinewy and taciturn.
	They were wild men, of a sort, yet there was still a wide
	gulf between them and the Cimmerian.  They were sons of
	civilization, reverted to a semi-barbarism.  He was a
	barbarian of a thousand generations of barbarians.  They had
	acquired stealth and craft, but he had been born to these
	things.  He excelled them even in lithe economy of motion.
	They were wolves, but he was a tiger.
		[ Conan - The Warrior, by Robert E. Howard ]
	A bat, flitting in the darkness outside, took the wrong turn
	as it made its nightly rounds and came in through the window
	which had been left healthfully open.  It then proceeded to
	circle the room in the aimless fat-headed fashion habitual
	with bats, who are notoriously among the less intellectually
	gifted of God's creatures.  Show me a bat, says the old
	proverb, and I will show you something that ought to be in
	some kind of a home.
		[ A Pelican at Blandings, by P.G. Wodehouse ]
	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap.  It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle.  When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place.  Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place.  The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape.  More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff.  They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.
		[ Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
	This giant variety of its useful normal cousin normally

	Hear the sledges with the bells --
	    Silver bells!
	What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
	How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
	    In the icy air of night!
	While the stars that oversprinkle
	All the heavens, seem to twinkle
	    With a crystalline delight;
	Keeping time, time, time,
	In a sort of Runic rhyme,
	To the tintinabulation that so musically wells
	From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
	    Bells, bells, bells --
	From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

	The blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the
	yellowish linen whereof those of the Amahagger who condescended
	to wear anything in particular made their dresses tightly round
	the eyes.  This linen I afterwards discovered was taken from the
	tombs, and was not, as I had first supposed, of native
	manufacture.  The bandage was then knotted at the back of the
	head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
	the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also
	blindfolded, I do not know why, unless it was from fear that she
	should impart the secrets of the route to us.

	On this particular day Blind Io, by dint of constant vigilance
	the chief of the gods, sat with his chin on his hand
	and looked at the gaming board on the red marble table in
	front of him.  Blind Io had got his name because, where his
	eye sockets should have been, there were nothing but two
	areas of blank skin.  His eyes, of which he had an impressively
	large number, led a semi-independent life of their
	own.  Several were currently hovering above the table.

	as the nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed
	tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy
	speed and driving before it a spiral, re-thickening cloud of the
	pallid abyss vapor.  It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster
	than any subway train -- a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic
	bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes
	forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the
	tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic
	penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its
	kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.

	I'd planned how to prevent the lock from sealing behind me; it

	force open the outer door until I returned and rejoined it.

	I worked the lever well under, and stretched my back; the end
	of the stone rose up, and I kicked the fulcrum under.  Then,
	when I was going to bear down, I remembered there was
	something to get out from below; when I let go of the lever,
	the stone would fall again.  I sat down to think, on the root
	of the oak tree; and, seeing it stand about the ground, I saw
	my way.  It was lucky I had brought a longer lever.  It would
	just reach to wedge under the oak root.
	Bearing it down so far would have been easy for a heavy man,
	but was a hard fight for me.  But this time I meant to do it
	if it killed me, because I knew it could be done.  Twice I
	got it nearly there, and twice the weight bore it up again;
	but when I flung myself on it the third time, I heard in my
	ears the sea-sound of Poseidon.  Then I knew this time I
	would do it; and so I did.

	day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small
	chocolate bar to eat all by himself.  And each time he
	received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would
	place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
	treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for
	the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it,
	but never to touch it.  Then at last, when he could stand it
	no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper
	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The
	next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and
	so on.  And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar
	of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.

	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

	A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the

	It is often very hard to discover what any given Demon looks
	like, apart from a general impression of large size, huge
	fangs, staring eyes, many limbs, and an odd color; but all
	accounts agree that Demons are very powerful, very Magic (in

	through a keyhole yet not be pierced with a Sword.  This makes
	them difficult to deal with, even on the rare occasions when
	they are friendly.

	The most famous and the first to be named of the imaginary
	"minerals" of Star Trek is dilithium. ... Because of this
	mineral's central role in the storyline, a whole mythology
	surrounds it.  It is, however, a naturally occurring substance
	within the mythology, as there are various episodes that
	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort.  That said, the real mineral that
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is
	ferroholmquistite which is a dilithium triferrodiallosilicate.
	If one goes on the premise that nature follows certain general
	norms, then one could extrapolate that dilithium might have a
	similar number of silicon atoms in its structure.
	Keeping seven (i.e. hepto) ferrous irons and balancing the
	oxygens would give a theoretical formula of Li2Fe7Al2Si8O27.

	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in

	There was a time when Rincewind had quite liked the iconoscope.
	He believed, against all experience, that the world was
	fundamentally understandable, and that if he could only equip
	himself with the right mental toolbox he could take the back off
	and see how it worked.  He was, of course, dead wrong.  The
	iconoscope didn't take pictures by letting light fall onto
	specially treated paper, as he had surmised, but by the far
	simpler method of imprisoning a small demon with a good eye for
	colour and a speedy hand with a paintbrush.  He had been very
	upset to find that out.

	This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard
	powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries
	it, allowing them to cast spells more often.  It also reduces
	any spell damage to the person who carries it by half, and
	protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has
	the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the
	dungeon, allowing its invoker to travel quickly between
	areas.
	The Eyes of the Overworld is a rather obscure artifact.
	These magical lenses push the wearer's view sense into the

	is also able to look back and see the area around herself,
	much like looking on a map.  Why anyone would want to ...

	With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
	the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark
	of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
	already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against
	the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the
	glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow
	eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
	motion agitated its limbs.

	How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how
	delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I
	had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I
	had selected his features as beautiful.  Beautiful!--Great God!
	His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
	arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
	flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
	only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
	seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in
	which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight
	black lips.

	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men

	Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,

	But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
	His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
	So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
	The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
	Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,
	And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
	And orbits.  Colours variegated more

	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
	and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
	ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter

	that they could not be sure what they saw; but with a
	splintering crash, the carven lid of the sarcophagus burst
	outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied from
	within and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the
	occupant -- a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried
	brown limbs like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.
	"Bring that thing back?" muttered the small dark man who
	stood on the right, with a short, sardonic laugh.  "It is

	But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare,
	and his lips parted in amazement.  At the same instant Lestrade
	gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the
	ground.  I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol,
	my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out
	upon us from the shadows of the fog.  A hound it was, an
	enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes
	have ever seen.  Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes
	glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and
	dewlap were outlined in flickering flame.  Never in the
	delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more
	savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that
	dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall
	of fog.

	Messenger and herald of the Olympians.  Being required to do
	a great deal of travelling and speaking in public, he became
	the god of eloquence, travellers, merchants, and thieves.  He
	was one of the most energetic of the Greek gods, a
	Machiavellian character full of trickery and sexual vigour.
	Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable
	sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
	He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity
	of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young
	man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical
	herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the
	kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way
	to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.  He is said
	to have invented, among other things, the lyre, Pan's Pipes,
	numbers, the alphabet, weights and measures, and sacrificing.

	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more

	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
	wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul

	fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the

	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted

	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip

	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by

	Here lies the noble fearless knight,
	Whose valour rose to such a height;
	When Death at last had struck him down,
	His was the victory and renown.
	He reck'd the world of little prize,
	And was a bugbear in men's eyes;
	But had the fortune in his age
	To live a fool and die a sage.

	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both
	poetry and philosophy in this fact, but most of all, there is
	humor.  Sennett got the humor.)

	Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it

	hold of Frodo's foot, and was dragging him into the water.

	Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various
	orifices had been stoppered with rubies, and with several of
	his eyes on the Lady he rolled three fives.  She smiled.  This
	was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright green,
	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.

	"A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the
	Crocodile God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well,
	weally!"  With one claw he pushed a pile of bone-white tokens
	into the centre of the table.

	The Lady nodded slightly.  She picked up the dice-cup and held
	it as steady as a rock, yet all the Gods could hear the three
	cubes rattling about inside.  And then she sent them bouncing
	across the table.

	A six.  A three.  A five.

	Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the
	chance collision of several billion molecules, the die flipped
	onto a point, spun gently and came down a seven.  Blind Io
	picked up the cube and counted the sides.

	"Come _on_," he said wearily, "Play fair."

	When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed,
	and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the
	garden, which were in reality precious stones.  He then asked
	for some food.

	"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I
	have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it."

	Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp
	instead.  As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it
	might fetch a higher price.  Instantly a hideous genie
	appeared, and asked what she would have.  She fainted away,
	but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly:
	"Fetch me something to eat!"

	With this the wind increased, and the mill sails began to turn
	about; which Don Quixote espying, said, 'Although thou movest
	more arms than the giant Briareus thou shalt stoop to me.'
	And, after saying this, and commending himself most devoutly
	to his Lady Dulcinea, desiring her to succor him in that trance,
	covering himself well with his buckler, and setting his lance
	on his rest, he spurred on Rozinante, and encountered with the
	first mill that was before him, and, striking his lance into
	the sail, the wind swung it about with such fury, that it broke
	his lance into shivers, carrying him and his horse after it,
	and finally tumbled him a good way off from it on the field in
	evil plight.

	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you
	is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava
	come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.  The
	glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a
	blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
	The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy
	smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the
	thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.
	Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the
	murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one
	side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured
	rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.
	An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the
	volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a
	bottomless pit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense
	geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren
	island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence
	of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the
	already hellish scene.  A dark, forboding passage exits to the
	south.

	In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender
	goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and
	brought them many gifts of food and clothing for their
	journey.  The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes,
	made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,
	and inside was the colour of cream.  Gimli took up one of the
	cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.
	'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp
	corner and nibbled at it.  His expression quickly changed,
	and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.
	'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing.  'You have
	eaten enough already for a long day's march.'
	'I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dalemen
	make for journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.
	'So it is,' they answered.  'But we call it lembas or

	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.

	But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second
	apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when
	it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy
	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had
	wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and
	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with
	one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us,
	and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm
	arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems,
	reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

	Originating in India (Mitra), Mithra is a god of light who
	was translated into the attendant of the god Ahura Mazda in
	the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
	the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
	sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
	plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
	power of darkness.

	challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has
	two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to
	Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it
	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's

		[ Leviticus 20:1-5 ]
	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".

	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"

	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."

	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

	The morning star was a medieval weapon resembling a mace, but
	with a large spike on the end and smaller spikes around the
	circumference.  It was also known as the goedendag (from the
	Dutch word for "good day") and the holy water sprinkler (from
	its resemblance to the aspergillum sometimes used in the
	Catholic Mass).  It was used by both cavalry and infantry;
	the horseman's weapon typically had a shorter haft than the
	footman's, which might be up to six feet long.  It came into
	use in the beginning of the 14th century.

	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a

	Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion
	back.  Before them rose the great shimmering white form of Satha,
	an ageless hate in its eyes.  Conan tensed himself for one mad
	berserker onslaught -- to thrust the glowing faggot into that
	fiendish countenance and throw his life into the ripping sword-
	stroke.  But the snake was not looking at him.  It was glaring
	over his shoulder at the man called Pelias, who stood with his
	arms folded, smiling.  And in the great, cold, yellow eyes
	slowly the hate died out in a glitter of pure fear -- the only
	time Conan ever saw such an expression in a reptile's eyes.

	snake was gone.

	_Uncertainty Principle_  The principle that it is not possible

	location itself alters the position of the particle
	in an unpredictable way.  To locate the position accurately,
	photons of short wavelength would have to be used.  The high
	momentum of such photons would cause a large effect on the
	position.  On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta
	would have less effect on the particle's position, but would
	be less accurate because of the lower wavelength.

	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds
	of contention came from the direction of the work-room.
	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue
	bird-like creature, some six feet in height.

	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep
	in his fulgurite and Sarsem perched in the rafters."
		[...]
	"No matter," said Rhialto.  "He has brought Sarsem, and this
	was his requirement.  In the main, Osherl, you have done well!"

	"And my indenture point?"

	"Much depends upon Sarsem's testimony.  Sarsem, will you sit?"

	"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."

	"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at
	the table?"

	"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene
	in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair
	like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at
	the table but declined refreshment.  "This human semblance,
	though typical, is after all, only a guise.  If I were to put
	such things inside myself, I might well become uneasy."

	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

	There have been three general theories put forward to explain
	the phenomenon of the wandering shops or, as they are
	generically known, _tabernae vagantes._
	The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there
	evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent
	was to buy cheap and sell dear.  Soon they controlled a vast
	galactic empire or, as they put it, Emporium, and the more
	advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very
	shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark
	walls of space itself and open up vast new markets.  And long
	after the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of
	their particular universe, after one last defiant fire sale,
	the wandering starshops still ply their trade, eating their way
	through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three-
	volume novel.
	The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate,
	charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing
	at the right time.
	The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting
	around the various Sunday Closing acts.
	All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in
	common.  They explain the observed facts, and they are
	completely and utterly wrong.

	Sokoban (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a transport puzzle
	in which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from

	The Egyptian god of the moon and wisdom, Thoth is the patron
	deity of scribes and of knowledge, including scientific,
	medical and mathematical writing, and is said to have given
	mankind the art of hieroglyphic writing.  He is important as
	a mediator and counsellor amongst the gods and is the scribe
	of the Heliopolis Ennead pantheon.  According to mythology,
	he was born from the head of the god Seth.  He may be
	depicted in human form with the head of an ibis, wholly as an
	ibis, or as a seated baboon sometimes with its torso covered
	in feathers.  His attributes include a crown which consists
	of a crescent moon surmounted by a moon disc.
	Thoth is generally regarded as a benign deity.  He is also
	scrupulously fair and is responsible not only for entering
	in the record the souls who pass to afterlife, but of
	adjudicating in the Hall of the Two Truths.  The Pyramid
	Texts reveal a violent side of his nature by which he
	decapitates the adversaries of truth and wrenches out their

	With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone
	Ever put on; a miserable crowd,
	Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud,
	"Thou art our king,
	O Death! to thee we groan."
	Those steps I clomb; the mists before me gave

	A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
	an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great

	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
	of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of

	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:

	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.

	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.

	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are
	powerful muscular animals with bushy tails.  Intelligent,
	social animals, wolves live in family groups or packs made
	up of multiple family units.  These packs cooperate in hunting
	down prey.
	1.  Any of various, usually poisonous perennial herbs of the
	genus Aconitum, having tuberous roots, palmately lobed leaves,
	blue or white flowers with large hoodlike upper sepals, and an
	aggregate of follicles.  2.  The dried leaves and roots of
	some of these plants, which yield a poisonous alkaloid that
	was formerly used medicinally.  In both senses also called
	monkshood.
		[ The American Heritage Dictionary of
		    the English Language, Fourth Edition. ]
	Come, old broomstick, you are needed,
	Take these rags and wrap them round you!
	Long my orders you have heeded,
	By my wishes now I've bound you.
	Have two legs and stand,
	And a head for you.
	Run, and in your hand
	Hold a bucket too.
	...
	See him, toward the shore he's racing
	There, he's at the stream already,
	Back like lightning he is chasing,
	Pouring water fast and steady.
	Once again he hastens!
	How the water spills,
	How the water basins
	Brimming full he fills!
	  [ The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
	      translation by Edwin Zeydel ]
	The Usenet Oracle requires an answer to this question!

	> How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
	> chuck wood?

	"Oh, heck!  I'll handle *this* one!"  The Oracle spun the terminal
	back toward himself, unlocked the ZOT-guard lock, and slid the
	glass guard away from the ZOT key.  "Ummmm....could you turn around
	for a minute?  ZOTs are too graphic for the uninitiated.  Even *I*
	get a little squeamish sometimes..."  The neophyte turned around,
	and heard the Oracle slam his finger on a computer key, followed
	by a loud ZZZZOTTTTT and the smell of ozone.
		[ Excerpted from Internet Oracularity 576.6 ]
	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
		[ wump (6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]

	_Wumpus yobgregorii_, in the flesh...
	Later, all you will be able to remember are its eyes.  They
	are rich mud-brown, and they hold your own without effort.
		[ Hunter, In Darkness, by Andrew Plotkin ]
	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...

	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
	knew the names of all twelve.
			[ Popul Vuh, as translated by Ralph Nelson ]
	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
	battle-weary adventurer.
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.
		[ The Encyclopedia of Monsters, by Daniel Cohen ]
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.
		[ W.B. Seabrook ]
	The zruty are wild and gigantic beings, living in the
	wildernesses of the Tatra mountains.
